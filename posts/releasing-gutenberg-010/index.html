You can build pretty much any kind of static site with it using markdown:<ul><li>a basic blog<li>a landing site<li>a knowledge base<li>a gitbook<li>a documentation site<li>all of the above combined</ul><p>You can download built binaries from the <a href=https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/releases>Github releases page</a>. If you were using Gutenberg through Cargo, I will not upload new versions to crates.io for three reasons:<ul><li><a href=https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/2263>package for binary crates don't use the Cargo.lock</a> which means a dependency having breaking changes without respecting SemVer will cause the crate to compile but <a href=https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/issues/92>fail at runtime</a> in some cases<li>I moved to using a Cargo workspace with many small crates to improve iteration speed<li>with Sass, building Gutenberg has become more involved and it is easier to let user install the already built binary</ul><p>As mentioned in <a href=https://ashang.github.io/zz/posts/releasing-gutenberg-010/2017-03-25_announcing-gutenberg.md>my article introducing Gutenberg</a>, my main issue with Hugo is the extremely poor — and I'm being kind here — template engine it is using. This was solved in the first release of Gutenberg by using a template engine similar to Jinja2 I wrote: <a href=https://github.com/Keats/tera>Tera</a>.<p>Another annoying thing was that, since I was using <a href=http://sass-lang.com/>Sass</a> to write CSS, each static site had to set up Sass compilation, usually with node/yarn/gulp.<p>With Gutenberg 0.1.0, this is solved as it ships with a static version of libsass, the C++ Sass compiler and allows commits like <a href=https://gitlab.com/Keats/vincent.is/commit/2a05cdad4cfd9dac103c9907488ad71518886440>this one</a>.<p>Let's have a look at the current set of features - it's pretty packed for a 0.1.0:<ul><li><strong>live reload</strong>: when anything changes, Gutenberg will do the minimum work required and will live reload assets (js/css/images/...) if possible<li><strong>syntax highlighting</strong> built-in via <a href=https://github.com/trishume/syntect>syntect</a><li><strong>pagination</strong><li><strong>easy internal linking</strong>: they look like <code>[my article](blabla.md)</code><li><strong>automatic table of contents</strong><li><strong>automatic insertion of anchors on titles</strong>: same as <a href=https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg>READMEs on Github</a><li><strong>shortcodes</strong>: when you want to insert some HTML in a page but don't want to copy the HTML everywhere. For example <code>{{ youtube(id="dQw4w9WgXcQ") }}</code> is a built-in shortcode and will insert the YouTube video for that id.<li><strong>Sass compilation</strong><li><strong>RSS feed</strong> generation when requested<li><strong>Tags and categories</strong> generation when requested<li><strong>co-location of assets and content</strong>: when an article has some images and you want to keep them in the same folder</ul><h2 id=what-s-next>What's next</h2><p>The current features are pretty much what I wanted to have when I started Gutenberg but that doesn't mean there isn't anything left to do!<h3 id=i18n>i18n</h3><p>The discussion started on <a href=https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/issues/13>github</a> but as it isn't a feature I need, I would rather have someone else doing it, once there is consensus on the implementation<h3 id=alternative-rendering-backends>Alternative rendering backends</h3><p>Right now, only markdown is supported. While I definitely don't want to have too many backend, <a href=http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/>Asciidoc</a> is one I was interested in and <a href=https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/issues/32>antoyo</a> started working on a asciidoc implementation so it should be coming eventually!<h3 id=theme-support>Theme support</h3><p><a href=https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/issues/91>An issue</a> was opened on Gutenberg to support themes. While the idea in the issue is IMO too complex, I would like to have some theme support baked in <code>gutenberg</code>, unless the <code>git clone a-template-repo</code> approach is simpler.<h3 id=deploying>Deploying</h3><p>A subcommand to upload/push the generated site to Github Pages/server/service could be nice. Maybe this can be resolved with documentation instead though.<h3 id=a-documentation-site>A documentation site</h3><p>Now that things are a bit more stable in Gutenberg, I will start working on a documentation site as Gutenberg Readme is currently not nearly enough. I've already started one for <a href=https://github.com/Keats/tera/tree/master/docs>Tera</a> and am mostly waiting for design inspiration before publishing it.<h3 id=packaging>Packaging</h3><p>Lastly, I think it's time to put Gutenberg in <a href=https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/issues/12>packages managers</a>. I will probably put it on <a href=https://aur.archlinux.org/>AUR</a> if no one beats me to it but I will need help for the other package managers.<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>As always I welcome any feedback. If you are using Gutenberg, please reply on <a href=https://github.com/Keats/gutenberg/issues/100>this issue</a> so I can update the list in the README.<p>Joyeux 14 Juillet!</section></article></main></div>
