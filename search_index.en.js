compile-time type checker.\nhttps://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-from-scratch.html\nJavaScript’s equality operator (==) coerces its operands, leading to unexpected behavior:\nif (\"\" == 0) {\n// It is! But why??\n}\nif (1 &lt; x &lt; 3) {\n// True for any value of x!\n}\nJavaScript also allows accessing properties which aren’t present:\nconst obj = { width: 10, height: 15 };\n// Why is this NaN? Spelling is hard!\nconst area = obj.width * obj.heigth;\nJavaScript code that you can run in your browser, and it will log a value:\nconsole.log(4 / []);\nThis syntactically-legal program logs Infinity. TypeScript, though, considers division of number by an array to be a nonsensical operation, and will issue an error:\nconsole.log(4 / []);\nThe right-hand side of an arithmetic operation must be of type 'any', 'number', 'bigint' or an enum type.\nTypeScript is also a programming language that preserves the runtime behavior of JavaScript. For example, dividing by zero in JavaScript produces Infinity instead of throwing a runtime exception. As a principle, TypeScript never changes the runtime behavior of JavaScript code.\nThis means that if you move code from JavaScript to TypeScript, it is guaranteed to run the same way, even if TypeScript thinks that the code has type errors.\nKeeping the same runtime behavior as JavaScript is a foundational promise of TypeScript because it means you can easily transition between the two languages without worrying about subtle differences that might make your program stop working.\nErased Types\nRoughly speaking, once TypeScript’s compiler is done with checking your code, it erases the types to produce the resulting “compiled” code. This means that once your code is compiled, the resulting plain JS code has no type information.\nThis also means that TypeScript never changes the behavior of your program based on the types it inferred. The bottom line is that while you might see type errors during compilation, the type system itself has no bearing on how your program works when it runs.\nFinally, TypeScript doesn’t provide any additional runtime libraries. Your programs will use the same standard library (or external libraries) as JavaScript programs, so there’s no additional TypeScript-specific framework to learn.\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/JavaScript\nJavaScript 是一种基于原型、多范式、单线程的动态语言，并且支持面向对象、命令式和声明式（如函数式编程）风格。\nJavaScript 的动态特性包括运行时对象的构造、变量参数列表、函数变量、动态脚本创建（通过 eval）、对象内枚举（通过 for...in 和 Object 工具方法）和源代码恢复（JavaScript 函数会存储其源代码文本，可以使用 toString() 进行检索）。\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/2023-year-end-notes/","title":"2023 Year end

Page / Sergei Brin, Jack Dorsey，是 John Gruber, Keso。「Everybody」所做的創造性活動（說生產性活動準確一點），其實跟《黑客帝國》裡的人肉電池差不多。說到底，創造是一種投資，當對回報的期待很低時，投資也不會很大。\n没有所谓\"经理人\"这一层，人都在做自己喜欢的事情，并且创造价值，而其他的事情，就顺其自然让他发生。这里能节省多少官僚主义带来的浪费？这样的公司得跑得有多快？得有多少无谓的冲突消解于无形？能形成多惊人的创新文化啊？\nGitHub就是一家尝试无线趋近这种理想主义的公司！程序猿（媛）们应该都知道GitHub，GitHub是一个开发员的协作平台，截至2014年统计，有超过340万用户，而且正在迅速商业化。\nGitHub是一家建立在开源软件上的私营的盈利公司，但是整个运作过程中，他们都在实践开源协作的精神——整个公司都倡导志愿工作。还是不明白到底怎么玩的？且听我给你解释。\n开放式工作分配\n大多数公司工作都是这么安排的：公司高层想到一个项目，于是经过立项，财务预算，及人员调配之后，自顶向下把项目分配到各个团队和业务单元。在GitHub可没这样，他们的人采用\"开放式工作分配\"的方式——人自行解决自己项目分配的问题，他们把自己分配到自己想做的项目上去，用不着任何正是的申请或者管理层干预。\n您得吐槽了，GitHub才多少人啊？就175个员工，当然玩的转这种方式了。不过您瞧瞧Valve软，他们有400员工，而公司毛收入达100亿美元，Valve的组织形式跟GitHub非常接近。这总可以说明点什么事吧。\n为什么要说公司的结构？\n古时候刀耕火种的人们就在思考，用自己过剩的产能能做点啥第二第三产业？比如，打猎之余，种点庄稼，缝点衣服啥的拿到集上去卖。有人做过研究了，那些过剩的产能中，最有可能造成影响的，是人脑子里面那些过剩的创造力！\n于是Google著名的20%的时间可以做点业余项目。有个叫克莱·舍基的人，写了一本书，书名叫《认知盈余-网络时代的创造与繁荣》，他有个观点，闲暇时间给人机会创造有价值的东西。\n直观上，这简直是胡说，就把人放到那里，从头到尾做他自己想做的事情，然后他就自然而然创造价值了？您心里估计在犯嘀咕，要是把那谁谁谁放到这里，她估计得7*24小时逛淘宝。\n不过，事实证明，这样的工作条件，对于那些有创造力的人确实有诱惑。比如说，有个叫Chrissie Brodigan的UX研究员，她有套测试方法叫Deprivation测试，以前是做火狐的用户体验评估的，就决定加入GitHub了。\nGitHub的员工反馈，说他们被开放式工作分配这种方式吸引，主要还是因为它没有什么边界——这些人喜欢自由选择跟自己气场相投的人一起做一些很酷的东西。他们甚至可以一起设计自己的可编程办公室。\n创新的四大难题\n有人得说了，这玩意真费事，搞这么乱干嘛，我才懒得管那些呢，公司告诉我做啥，我给他保质保量做好不就行了？\n我们得说，这个论点在有些行业当然是行得通的，比如前些年，在广东，浙江一带，有很多制衣厂，对于一个有资深制衣行业背景的人而言，如果你有明确的目标，比如目标人群，衣服的款型，销往哪个区域，这些能确定之后，他就能告诉你需要投多少钱，建多大规模的流水线，招什么样的技工，甚至每个环节的技工该做什么。\n不幸的是，今天，公司如果需要存活相当长一段时间的话，就需要面对未知的创新：如何创新？如何让这样的创新可以反复发生？传统公司会建立一个独立的\"创新部\"，这里的人负责创新，而其他的人更像在制衣厂工作。GitHub则不一样，他们把全公司都设立在一种以创新为核心的工作模式上的。这么做，是考虑到了让一批人能够持续不断成功创新的四大难题：\n\nGitHub的结构到底是怎么样的？\n沟通！沟通！沟通正是开放式工作分配的核心要素。换句话说，GItHub公司的结构就像是一张分布式的信息传递网络，网络上传递的是公司的目标，以及公司如何工作，当然也包括它应该要做些什么。\n创新公司的策略是不断调整的，而对于某一时期这些调整增量，让所有人的认知保持同步至关重要，否则有些微小的调整很难到达某些单元或者团队，当有些团队没有做出相应的调整，而最终累积到一定的时候，不同团队之间的就形成了鸿沟般的认知差距。你得说了，这没什么啊，我看到的公司都是这样的。举个例子，上个世纪80年代的时候，乔布斯带着一帮人，做成了比较成功的Macintosh，另一支团队则哼哧哼哧鼓捣出来Apple III，Apple III大家都懂的。\n良好的沟通，也可以帮助团队发现一些新的，或者相关的商机。举个例子，在这张网络里面，如果有一个新项目很酷，在网络里面传导到公司的高层了，高管们就可以利用这些信息修正航向，而修正的结果同时又通过网络传到各个单元，让他们明白，\"某某项目\"现在开始帮助实现公司的商业了。\n这怎么玩得起来？\n\n让人自己选择自己感兴趣的事情\n\nGitHub首先得弄清楚，自己作为一家公司，到底什么是最重要的，并把这些体现在公司的策略上。然后每个团队都应该做类似的事情，\"这是公司的策略，这是我们的产品，那对我们团队，什么最重要？\"，销售，技术支持，运维等团队都做了这样的事情，他们把自己团队的目标和公司战略目标做了匹配。而前面说到的信息网络，让这种组织形式更加高效。\n团队找到了工作重点，个人也要找自己的兴趣点，探索自己的兴趣跟这些策略的契合点，并把自己分配到那些能贡献的重要的事情上面去。所以，对个人来说，只要是对公司重要的事情，自己又有强烈的兴趣，就可以决定去做了。如果运转得好，所有人都在重要的事情上工作，不需要有人一层一层分配。这就是所谓的开放式工作分配方式(Open Allocation Approach)。\nopen_allocation\n举个GitHub的例子，有段时间3D打印机很火，有个叫Mike Skalnik的在公司买了台3D打印机之后就开始感兴趣了，他慢慢的从原来的项目里面抽出经历来鼓捣3D打印机。一开始的时候，天知道3D打印机跟一个开源项目代码协作平台有什么关系？而Mike渐渐鼓捣明白3D打印机了，后来他发现，可以用协作的方式跟其他人共同维护3D打印的模型文件，而这正好又跟GitHub的方向完全吻合的。\nMike后来就抽出越来越多的时间去尝试3D打印，到后来他成了3D打印项目的带头人。\n\n让更接近问题的人有决策权\n\nGitHub尝试把决策权移交给更加接近真实问题的人，在GitHub的项目中，每个项目都有一个主要负责人。\n你得说了，当然，我们团队每个团队也有个产品负责人啊。问题是，如何产生这样的人和这样的团队呢？一般公司，都有一个中高层经理，他把自己手底下的人分成小的团队，让他们每个团队负责一个区域，而每个区域，又有一个直线经理负责人员的调配，于是这个直线经理指派了一个人，说：\"你，就你了，作为产品负责人负责这个产品\"。于是产品负责人像一个牵线玩偶一样负责这一摊产品。这里有个巨大的问题，在于位于顶端的话事人，他得要预测一个比较成功的愿景，来告诉大家产品或者公司的方向。\n在开放式工作调配的方式中，前面这个过程基本上可以说是反过来的。GitHub认为，最接近待解决的问题的人应该是对问题最了解的人，他们很大可能性是最知道如何解决这类问题的。GitHub让这类人有这样的决策权。\n\n招那些喜欢这种方式的人\n\n我知道，还是有质疑的说，这不就是一片混乱吗？如何避免有人每天只逛淘宝？我们再回到前面说的，如果要有人花时间和精力去监控这些事情，或者搞办公室政治，那就说明要么是组织，要么是个人出问题了。\n很重要的一点是选合适的人，把他们引入团队。何谓合适的人？这些人应该本性就是积极主动，对技术和自己的事业一腔热情的人。这些成年人做的事情最终必将给给公司带来收益。当然肯定是有前提的，一般没有人说，\"好，我有热情，今天我花一天时间给同事们烤面包吃。\"（逢年过节可能有例外），每个人都深信，自己做的事情一定会在某种程度上给推进公司往前走。\n题外话\n世界真的是平的吗？\n有一段时间业界都在纠结，要把自己的组织打造成一个平的组织结构，其实大可不必纠结于多平才算是平，而是要把组织里面的各个点连成网，让信息能够自由流动。\n开源精神\n开源精神是说，一个人发现别人做的有个东西很酷，然后就给他们发了个消息，告诉他们，自己对这事有兴趣，希望能够贡献自己的力量，接下来项目的热就告诉这位热心的观众什么东西比较重要，后者再决定自己如何贡献。GitHub的工作模式也是这样的，也就是前面说的开放式工作分配。\n关于透明\n有人做组织转型的时候很纠结透明这件事情，而GitHub在倡导透明的同时，也留给团队和个人一些个人空间，如果团队希望暂时保留目前正在做的事情，到适当时机再公开，这样的决定也会被尊重的。\nGitHub这种方式有局限性吗？\n有!\n\n\n公司还是要付钱做一些重要，但是无趣的事情，比如升职奖金之类的。2\n\n\n高管很难招聘。一般公司招一个CEO，会相应的给CEO很大的授权，但是在一个网状组织里面，CEO很难直接下命令让其他人只是执行命令。CEO应该是对行业有深远的思考，至少在公司里面，他得证明自己是一个思想家。\n\n\n要炒人很难。一般要被炒的肯定是那种很恶劣的打酱油的，而在这样的开放式工作分配模式里面，要证明一个人是在打酱油也要花很多时间。不过相比传统的分配工作模式，还是有优势的，传统工作模式会产生更多打酱油的人。\n\n\n开放任务分配能在你的公司和组织里面运转吗？\n2008年，我写的《未来是湿的》（Here Comes Everybody）出版以后，一个电视制片人在试图决定是否让我在她的节目上讨论这本书时问我：“你认为目前社会性媒介有哪些有趣的用处？”\n　　我向她提起了维基百科（Wikipedia）—一部经协作完成的百科全书，我还向她提及了维基百科上关于冥王星的文章。早在2006年，冥王星就从太阳系行星俱乐部中被剔除了—天文学家认定它和其他行星很不一样，因此他们计划对行星进行重新定义，以将冥王星排除在外。此事件引发了维基百科上对冥王星这一词条的编辑高峰。涉及到冥王星地位的改变，人们频繁地对该词条进行编辑修改。最热衷于此事的一小组编辑人员中，在如何最贴切描述冥王星地位改变这一问题上，并未达成一致，于是他们在更新关于冥王星的文章时，从章节到句子甚至到词语的选择都互相较劲，最终把文章的本质内容从“冥王星是第九大行星”改成了“冥王星是一颗位于太阳系边缘，形状不规则，围绕不规则轨道旋转的石头”。\n　　我原以为那位制片人当听到维基百科这个案例后，会和我开始讨论关于知识的社会结构、权力的本质或者任何一个谈到维基百科会引出的话题，但是她没有问这些问题，相反她叹息道：“人们哪儿来的时间？”听到这些，我立马说：“别人可以问，但是做电视这一行的人绝对不能问这个问题。你应该清楚那些时间是从哪儿来的。”这是因为她供职于一个在过去50年中消磨掉人们大量自由时间的行业。\n　　想象一下，如果我们将全世界受教育者的自由时间看成一个集合体，一种认知盈余（Cognitive Surplus），那么这种盈余有多大？为了算清这笔账，我们需要一个计量单位，那么就让我们从维基百科开始吧。设想将所有人花在维基百科上的时间总数作为一种计量单位，截至我跟这位电视制片人说话的那一刻，人类用在维基百科的时间统统加起来，大概代表了1亿个小时的人类思考。这是马丁·沃登伯格（Martin Wattenberg）—一位致力于研究维基百科的IBM研究员，帮助我得到了这一数据。显然累计达1亿小时的思考时间已经很多了，然而这和我们花在电视上的时间相比，又算什么呢？美国人一年花在看电视上的时间大约2000亿个小时。这几乎是2000个维基百科项目每年所需要的时间。每周末我们都会花大约1亿小时只是用来看电视，这是很大一部分的时间盈余。而全球受教育者累积起来的自由时间每年超过1万亿小时！那些问“人们哪儿来的时间”的人没有意识到，相比我们全部拥有的自由时间的总和而言，维基百科项目所占用的时间多么微不足道。\n\n　　一开始，社会完全不知道如何处理任何盈余。大多数情况下，当我们余下一块很大规模的自由时间时—每年数以十亿计甚至数以万亿计小时—我们便会消磨在看电视上。因为我们认为以这种方式来消磨这部分时间是现有选择中最好的。诚然我们可以在室外玩耍、读书看报或者和朋友一起搞音乐创作，但大多数情况下我们不会这么做，因为与简单地窝在沙发上看电视相比，那些活动的门槛有些高。其实，发达国家人们的生活中包含了太多消极参与：我们在工作中是办公室寄生虫，回家后又成了沙发土豆。\n　　然而现在，首次出现了一部分年轻人看电视的时间少于他们父辈。一些针对中学生、宽带用户和YouTube用户的研究已经注意到了这种变化，并且这些观察的基本结果总是一致的：拥有更快捷互动媒介的年轻一代正在把他们的行为从单纯消费媒介中转变过来。当他们观看在线视频时，看似和看电视没什么两样，但他们却有机会针对这些素材发表评论、分享、贴上标签、评分或者排名，当然还可以和世界上其他观众一起讨论。丹·希尔（Dan Hill）在《为什么&lt;迷失&gt;会成为一种新媒介》中指出，这部电视剧的观众不仅仅是观众—他们协同创造了一部围绕此剧的内容汇编，叫做《迷失百科全书（Lostpedia）》。换句话说，当他们看电视时，会相互参与进来，而这种参与行为同消极的消费媒介行为存在区别。\n　　这种导致电视消费量减少的力量是微小的，同时又是庞大的。说它微小，是因为这种选择是个人行为—某人只是简单地决定下一个小时是用来和朋友聊天、玩游戏还是参与创造或分享一些事物，而不再是单纯地看电视；称其庞大是因为这是一群人的集体行为，是数以百万计的微小选择的集合。当整个人群不断累积转变对参与的态度，维基百科便成为可能。因此当电视行业看到这群人对使用自由时间的选择后，十分震惊。\n　　20世纪的媒介作为一种单一事件发展着：消费。其实，媒体应该由三部分组成——消费、创造和分享。21世纪，互联网技术让人们创造与分享的需求得到实现，人类每年盈余的1万亿小时终于有了更好的“消磨”选择。2010年，全球通过互联网联系到一起的人口超过20亿，手机用户早已突破0亿，而全球的成年人是45亿。可以说，我们生活在一个崭新的历史时期—对大多数地球居民来说，通过网络使个人作为全球范围内互动组织的一部分已经变得再正常不过。如今是一个不平凡的时代，由于网络的发明和扩散，使得以前被排除在外的普通民众能够利用自由时间从事自己喜欢或关心的活动。我们现在可以把自由时间当做一种普遍的社会资产，用于大型的共同创造的项目，而不是一组仅供个人消磨的一连串时间。\n\n　　自由时间是一种资源，它随着40小时工作周制度的兴起，迎来了历史上第一次激增。二战后，人口增加、人民身体素质提高、教育机会增多、社会繁荣昌盛，这样的环境又使得自由时间继续增长。而我要讲的资源不仅仅是指我们累积起来的空闲时间，这不足以构成认知盈余，原因是我们缺乏使用空闲时间的手段。\n　　如今，自由时间转变为认知盈余也不仅关乎新的社会工具，虽然支持公众参与、分享与讨论的媒体很新鲜，但是只有分享的方法而缺少分享动机也没有多大意义。任何行为都需要提供能够开发某些人类真正动机的机会。例如，如果我告诉你我发明了一种能让你的校友可以更便捷地找到你的工具，你可能会不屑一顾，而当我告诉你我发明了一种能让你的老同学们主动联系你的工具，你可能会对这个提议另眼相看。正如Facebook、西班牙的Twenty、中国的QQ这些社交网络服务的崛起所昭示的，这样的连接是全世界社交媒体最流行的用途之一。\n　　途径、动机和机会三者的融合，从累积的自由时间这个原材料中，生产出了认知盈余。真正的变化来自于我们认识到这种盈余带来了前所未有的机会，或者更确切地说，它带来了前所未有的让我们为彼此创造机会的机会。这种低成本的实验和巨大的潜在用户基数意味着如果某人萌发出一个需要数十个或上千个人参与才能实现的点子，那么现在就能以非常低的成本进行尝试且无需事先得到任何人的允许。\n　　如今，所有这些最基本的改变已然发生，这既新奇又让人惊讶。但是关于认知盈余，尚未发生的、尚未解决的，是当我们将它作为一个共享和累积的资源看待时，哪种价值最终会从中凸现出来。鉴于目前创造性和慷慨行为的爆炸性增长，我们可以假设对认知盈余的良好利用指日可待。这话不假，但只是对某些潜在应用而言。\n　　最早，对认知盈余的成功利用是技术团体中的计算机编程。在那里，人们充分理解协作，因此参与文化的障碍少之又少。致力于类似Apache、Linux等开源项目的程序员，通常被定义为以积极眼光看待参与的人。如今，像开源模式这样的共同创造已经散布到其他非技术领域，从拼车到病人互助小组。不过，在不少人眼中，任何业余者的参与要么是天真的，要么就是愚蠢的。作为人类社会，我们应该用大家共享和累积的资源及人们期望参与的美德做些什么？这是一个宽广的对话话题，光是想想这个话题，就让人觉得充满诱惑。\n　　如今，个人和集体价值的资源正逐渐把这个世界充满，这些价值主要由参与者创造和捕获。但是我们不能指望各种能为社会带来益处的新活动会自动发生，创造一种能给社会带来更广泛利益的参与文化，可比分享几张搞笑照片要难得多。我们在多大程度上能把握住这种社会变化？\n　　2007年12月，一次极具争议的总统选举使得肯尼亚陷入针锋相对的境地。当地一名政治活跃人士奥瑞·奥科罗（Ory Okolloh）在博客上记录了肯尼亚政府禁止主流媒体报道而引发的暴力冲突。她请读者对他们所见证的暴力行为通过电子邮件或者在她的博客上发表评论的方式传递出来。她的博客成为重要的信息来源，人们对此事的关注度不断上升。后来为了高效收集与处理相关信息，奥瑞·奥科罗设想了一种服务平台并把它命名为“Ushahidi”(斯瓦希里语，意为“目击”或“证明”)，这个平台可以自动收集群众的报道并且能在地图上实时显示冲突地点。她在博客中流露出了这个想法，引起了两位程序员的兴趣，他们三人进行了一次电话会议，仔细讨论了如何使Ushahidi平台有效地运作。3天后，第一版Ushahidi平台问世了。\n　　Ushahidi启动数月后，哈佛大学肯尼迪政治学院做了一次分析。经过对比Ushahidi和主流媒体提供的数据，他们认为Ushahidi在报道暴力冲突的发生、冲突后的抗议以及非死亡暴力事件方面做得更好，并且报道范围也更大，它涵盖了广阔的地理区域，包括农村地区。自从2008年首次亮相以来，Ushahidi已经被用于追踪刚果民主共和国内类似的暴力事件，用于监督印度和墨西哥的投票地点及预防投票者作弊，用于报道数个东非国家的重要药品供应量，还曾用于海地和智利地震后搜救伤员。\n　　我将认知盈余创造的这种价值称为公民（civic）价值。这种价值不会因为社会的突然转型而凸显出来，也不会从个体行为中冒出来，反而公民价值是从群体工作中衍生出来的，起初是很小的群体，接着规模和重要性便会不断增加。如果我们想创造新形式的公民价值，就需要我们增强小团体尝试创新事物的能力。以群体形式尝试新事物是迄今为止，也是将来对社会性媒体最为意义深远的运用。\n　　对于下一个好点子会是怎么样的，任何人都没有十足把握。在发生如此多改变的时代，寻找绝佳点子的机会，就是让尽可能多的群体利用人类的认知盈余，去尝试尽可能多的事物。（原载《全球商业经典》杂志\n“认知盈余”的本质是，如果把人当成一个有限社会资源的集合体（时间，智力资源），在传统媒介时代，这种资源在投入到谋生目的之外的剩余部分大多用于个人娱乐消耗，而在网络媒介时代，剩余资源通过群体协作和个人行为聚合汇集成公共性的社会资源，进而创造出丰富的文明成果，于是我们有了维基，有了twitter/ facebook，有了youtube,有了知乎。。。。\n如果给“认知盈余”一个形象的比喻，那就是“认知盈余”是信息时代的剩余价值。信息时代的繁荣有赖于各种商业机构或非盈利机构对这种剩余价值的引导和利用或者“压榨”。 在网络时代，即使单纯的个人娱乐行为，也不再仅仅是简单的个人时间资源消耗问题，而是变成了分享和参与特征的互动性社会行为，比如：单纯的盯着电视发呆傻笑变成，在视频网站上边看边留言并分享内容。几乎消耗同样的时间，做着同样的利己性娱乐行为，前者就是纯粹的“时间盈余”，后者就进化成“认知盈余”了。感觉有只“无形的手”再操纵人类的这种利用“认知盈余”的行为，以利己为出发点，以利他为终点。\n有个我也在琢磨的问题可以作为这个问题的引申问题：\n为什么我们这个时代的人，会倾向于使用“认知盈余”，而不仅仅是消耗“时间盈余”？\n有很多可以想象的情境中，人的这种行为并没有明显的自我实现的收益。而往往表现的是一种无意识和下意识，比如回答个简单的问题，添加个内容分类和标签，转载和分享一下。\n\n发布于 2012-08-21\n\n什么是认知盈余？\n什么是认知盈余？\n什么是认知盈余？\n什么是认知盈余？\n互联网已经出现了五十年，万维网技术也已出现了三十年，社会中以往喜欢将大量自由时间用于消费的个体成员开始主动创造并分享事物，但仍有很多人对此感到惊讶。\n举例来说，快手日活用户1.6亿，人均使用时长超过70分钟，整体计算下来，快手用户日均使用时长高达2.1万年。这是一个很惊人的数字。\n用户在快手上花这么多时间干什么？他们每天上传超过1000万条视频，最大的两个内容品类，一个叫生活场景，一个叫才艺。很多之前被忽视的群体得以显现自身。\n不止是快手，同样的一个机制作用在相当多的互联网应用上。大多数曾经在网上搜索过的人，都遇到过在线百科全书维基百科。维基百科是由具有某些主题知识、并希望为这一全球免费信息来源做出贡献的人们合作开发的。他们是否因为这样的贡献而获得报酬或信誉？并没有，他们是纯粹的志愿者。他们志愿做事，因为他们有时间，同时具备慷慨之心。这就是认知盈余。\n认知盈余是克莱·舍基（Clay Shirky）创造的短语，我们可以将其理解为人们在时间、智慧、创造力和慷慨之心等方面的盈余的集合体，可以经由技术手段提升生产力、实现创造和分享。\n自由时间下的创造与分享\n我们的时间盈余有多大呢？眼下，40亿人通过互联网相互连接，全球网民的平均上网时间已达6小时/天，这差不多相当于，在我们醒着的时候，至少三分之一的时间都用来上网了。如果把全世界上网人口的上网时间加在一起，2018 年，全球网虫们在网上消耗的时间大约相当于 10 亿年。\n在智慧盈余方面，互联网的一个重要特性是，它可以利用大群人的集体智慧来解决问题。很容易看出网络如何改变了我们的购物方式，我们消费媒体的方式以及我们彼此之间的沟通方式，但它也开始改变我们做出决策的方式，甚至预测未来的方式。\n在创造力盈余方面，少数人使用廉价的工具，投入很少时间和金钱，就能在社会中开拓出足够多的集体善意，创造出数年前无人能够想象的资源。道理很简单：人们想做一些事情来让世界变得更美好。虽然互联网有自身的缔造者，但我们也可以毫不犹豫地说，互联网发展至今，是每个参与者在全世界范围内的共同创造。\n没有慷慨就没有互联网\n没有人类慷慨的世界就像没有润滑油的内燃机——它很快就会过热，熄火。慷慨，和信任与互惠一样，为人类蓬勃发展所必需的功能性社会和制度关系提供必要的润滑剂。但是，慷慨不仅仅是社会机制顺利运作的必要条件。慷慨本身有助于确定人类生活和社会的良好状况。\n成为一个蓬勃发展的人，本身就是在练习慷慨。没有一个吝啬的人会真正兴旺。社会也是如此。促进其成员广泛繁荣的良好社会不仅取决于、而且体现和促进慷慨，无论是在个人之间还是在制度上。最终，在人类社会中所发现的所有自利、竞争和冲突之下，是人们对自己和他人福祉的关心程度和质量，构成良好的人类生活和好社会的定义。\n网络建立在人类的慷慨精神之上，没有慷慨就没有互联网。例如，“用户生成的内容”（user-generated content）这个当前用于描述业余者的创造行动的词组所阐述的其实不仅仅是个人行为，更是一种社会行为。UGC不仅仅是由用户生成的，它更是被用户分享的东西。事实上，不仅创造是愉悦的来源——分享也是。\n在慷慨的基础上，我们得以发展出利他主义。今天，人类面临的问题在其范围和重要性上史无前例。核毁灭、温室效应、物种灭绝、环境灾难、恐怖主义仅仅是其中的几个例子。找到如何解决这些全球性问题的办法，无论对于个体还是对于群体来说，都堪称构成了21世纪的最大挑战。为了克服这些挑战，我们需要世界意识的新转折，监测技术创新的新方法，新的社会发明，以及新形式的富于创造性的利他主义。\n互联网和移动技术为我们提供了探索这种新式利他主义的多种可能。有理由相信，通过将道德关怀与数字技术结合起来，人类将会创造一种崭新的数字利他主义（digital altruism），从而可以通过群体的努力，解决横亘前方的诸多困难，甚至是在极大的规模上。\n认知盈余产生的价值类型\n人们一直在学习如何更有建设性地利用自由时间进行创造性行为，而不是消费性行为，特别是随着允许新形式合作的在线工具的出现，更加推动了这一趋势。\n导致消费量减少的选择可以是微小的，同时又是庞大的。微小的选择是一种个人行为；某人只是简单地决定下一个小时要用来创造一些事物，而不是单纯被动地消费。然而数以百万计的微小选择的集合，最终可能导致庞大的集体行为。全世界的认知盈余太多了，多到即使微小的变化都能累积为巨大的结果。\n从类型上看，认知盈余产生了四种不同的价值：个人价值、群体价值、公共价值和公民价值。\n个人价值：个人价值是我们主动行动，作为创造者而非消费者所获得的价值。个人创造和分享所产生的大多数价值都仅仅是参与者本身获益。\n群体价值：群体价值的参与性更强，在一个协作的群体之间进行，例如一个应对产后忧郁症的小组，为小组成员的合作利益服务。\n公共价值：协作群体积极尝试创造公共资源，如Apache软件计划，目的是帮助群体之外的人们。\n公民价值：一个群体积极尝试改变社会，或者，在一个有利于整个社会的项目上进行合作。\n这些努力的影响可大可小，可以是与世界分享自拍照的微小个体，也可以是为了获得大量关注和支持以改变世界的某个层面而创建的Hashtags，如#metoo。必须承认，我们使用自身认知盈余的活动可能是轻浮的，但从整体趋势来看，它正在导致有价值和有影响力的新形式的人类表达。四种价值都是认知盈余的合法用途，但社交媒体提供的公民价值（也即实际改变社会的力量）应该是互联网最值得庆祝之处。\n设计新的参与及分享方式来利用认知盈余\n对认知盈余的利用使人们得以用更慷慨、更公开、更加社会化的方式来表现自己，这种变化的原材料是我们的自由时间，这样的时间我们可以用来投入到各个事业中去，从娱乐到文化变革。如今是一个不平凡的时代，因为我们现在可以把自由时间当作一种普遍的社会资产，用于大型的共同创造的项目，而不是一组仅供个人消磨的一连串时间。\n一开始社会完全不知道如何处理任何盈余。（这也是为什么这些时间会成为盈余的原因。）我们集体上来说不仅仅是盈余的来源；当我们得以联网，从而拥有任由我们支配的工具、以及这些工具所提供给我们的新机遇的时候，我们也是通过我们的参与和我们对彼此的期待来设计认知盈余用途的人。\n一个买主在购买奔驰汽车时领受恶劣服务，她的维权视频被发到网上，24小时内就被5600万人浏览关注，不到3天，浏览量飙升至2.6亿人次，掀起了一场维护消费市场公信力的全民运动。在若干个重大突发事件当中，公民们用可拍照手机提供了比摄影记者更完备的记录。用代码抗议996加班，集结在GitHub上的程序员，正在进行一场社会实验……不论在何处，你都能看见人们走到一起彼此分享，共同工作，或是发起某种公共行动。\n一部集众人之力的百科全书、一位知识女性愤而挑战大公司的传奇、因为一个公共话题和一种社会情绪而产生的临时性团体，这些事情看上去似乎没有什么联系，但它们乃至更多事情的影响实际上有着共同的根基：在人类历史上第一次，我们的交流工具支持群体对话与群体行动。聚集一群人并使之行动原本对资源有极高的要求，使得全世界范围内的群体努力都被置于一种制度的垄断之下。今天，全球分享与合作的工具终于交到了个体公民的手中。所以，我们作为设计者所要做的，就是不断为这些工具找到更多创新性的应用。\n现在，我们可以为爱做大事情了\n我们所习惯的世界里，人们为爱做小的事情，做大事则是为了钱。不过，现在，我们可以为爱做大事情了。\n也许我们可以毋需夸张地说，互联网是一个爱的大本营。互联网之所以拥有海量的内容，一个重大原因就是它构成了人类历史上最大的自愿项目之一。\n由于功率越来越强大、用途越来越广泛的新工具流落到普通人手里，一个个财富和社会奇迹被创造出来，从根本上改变了全世界工作、玩乐、生活和思考的方式。现在，我们需要学习用互联网来释放善意，创造普惠。\n进入

age），规模成了世界的主流和坐标。工业时代向数字时代、信息时代的转化过程中，规模成了轻而易举容易获得的事物，因为相比起工业品被制造，信息的被复制无疑更容易，也更容易私人化。\n舍基用了大量警示性的语句来强调规模在信息时代的重要性：\n“对于我们每年消耗的一万亿小时的空闲时间来说，任何转变——不管多么微小，都可能是很大一部分。”\n“当群体足够大时，不可预见的可以变得可预知。一个时间发生的可能性就是它可能发生的次数和频率的或然率。任何人类活动，无论看上去多么不可能，在人群中发生的可能性会增加。规模较大的盈余和小盈余就是不同。”\n自由的时间与时间的自由\n在英语中，Free有两重意思，一重是免费，另一重是自由。在互联网世界，或者说未来的互联时代中，它们都是对的。\n社会学家一直惊异于为何人们愿意在网络社区中做无偿劳动，例如维基百科的志愿者，微博中转帖的博友和公知。无酬工作的动力来自何处？\n在工业革命时代，工人们曾提出如下口号：“八小时工作，八小时睡觉，八小时自由时间”。电视时代带来了消耗自由时间的利器——电视。\n然而，在信息时代，人们的需求显然不能被电视所满足。舍基在书中一直在反复陈述一个段子：一个四岁的女孩子到电视背后寻找鼠标。人们不仅希望消费，也希望创造和分享。这是一个对自由时间于工业时代不同的解释。\n在人类的内在动机中，同时隐藏了自私和共享两种截然相反的基因，前者创造了市场、自由资本主义；后者创造了社区、慈善、NGO、信息共产主义。\n霍金曾悲观的认为，人类在两百年内面临毁灭，因为其内在的自私基因会导致人类无节制的消耗地球资源，所以应该尽快移居其他星球。乐观者则认为，人类内在的另一种基因——利他基因会从更大的范围内保护环境和生物的可持续发展，从而最终保护人作为种群的繁衍。\n自由的时间创造了认知盈余，互联网创建了创造和消费认知用于的平台，而以上两者为人们带来了时间的自由。\n这一切，源于数字时代的如下事实：一，复制、分享的边际成本趋近于零；二，互联网在创建网络市场经济的同时，也构建了对等交换的公益型社区，例如沙发驴友(couchsurfing)，拼车网 (pickuppal)\n二象性法则——新的时代注解\n舍基对于互联网时代消费、创造与分享的见解可以追溯到这一个理论的始作俑者，未来学家托夫勒。托夫勒在《第三次浪潮》中提出了产销一体化的概念解释了上世纪八十年代的前沿思想——人们在未来时代将既是生产者，又是消费者。\n这种二象性的提法在西方逻辑学中是个异类，但是现在已经越来越普遍。传统的西方逻辑学注重于事物非此即彼型的无限分割，意图追溯出世界创建的本源。然而事物的二象性，同时性，甚至多象性越来越成为解释世界的新法则。\n二象性法则可以追溯至量子力学的“波粒二象性”。量子力学以大量严谨的实验，在上世纪早期终于不可辨驳地证明光同时具有波和粒子两种不同的特性，从而突破了经典物理学的囿见，为人们认识世界提供了一个全新的视角和维度。\n古典经济学“供应”和“需求”两个维度是一个严格意义上的逻辑分割，凯恩斯在他的体系中增加了“投资”一个维度，但是他遵循的仍然是严格的逻辑体系。\n而我一直认为托夫勒的产销一体化是信息时代革命性的认知，他承认了人们同时具备消费者和生产者两种截然不同的属性。托夫勒的洞悉已经被无数互联网世界涌现的事实所证明。\n文明的每一次进步，都建立在对过往大厦的颠覆，以及对新秩序的建立的基础上，不断清空过往思维大厦的残余，迎接拥抱新的认知体系——这是世界不断进步的动力之源。\n市场机制与公益世界\n舍基讲道，在互联网上，人们既喜欢消费、也喜欢创造和分享，这是一种二象性，或者多象性。\n同样的原理，市场机制和公益世界也同样存在于互联时代（注意，舍基用的是互联时代 connected age，而不是互联网，我们未来的互联程度将远远超越互联网的局限），它也存在着二象性。\n市场行为和公益行为代表了人的两种不同动机外延。市场行为通常被认为更具效率，源于利己基因，而公益行为源于利他基因，更来自于兴趣、分享或同理心等动机。公益行为相较于市场行为，通常被认为效率更低下，但是可以组成规模更大的社区。一个典型案例是统治网络世界十多年的Apache Web服务器软件，这是一个由纯粹公益性的程序员社区发起的。\n市场机制是至今为止最有效率的组织形态，而在信息时代也许会面临着新的定义和注释。人们出于分享、兴趣、利他、成就感、社区虚荣心等各种原因为社区贡献智慧，而在无心插柳之间成就了社区的繁荣和辉煌，并且这是天然全球化的。\n公益行为的缘起往往是随机、偶然的。例如，舍基解释Apache社区的形成，是因为资源、资金的限制，试想如果IBM要完成同样规模的工作，雇佣几千名工程师需要多少成本？\n而当市场、公益混杂的行为与人们大量的自由时间结合时，属于互联网时代的奇迹就发生了。\n古登堡经济与工具的革命\n十五世纪古登堡印刷机改变了未来五百年的媒体、印刷品法则，也定义了“古登堡经济学”。我们目前所处的媒体世界，基本接受“古登堡经济学”的解释——通过高成本的固定资产投资，大量生产、印刷、复制纸面内容，并大量发行，从而获得高额经济回报。\n这个法则在数字经济时代被新的游戏规则颠覆，这是题外话。\n舍基的一个重要观点是，工具的便利性推动了这个世界的进化——有许多世界的变化来自于工具产生的偶然性事件，正如古登堡印刷机推动了《圣经》和基督教在全世界的普及。\n而在今天，新的互联化工具层出不穷，软件、大数据计算成了统治世界的王者，推动着人类的效率从一个阶梯迈向另一个天梯。工具的诞生，刺激着组织形态的不断演化：个人分享、公共分享、公用分享，直至公民分享。\n我们能看到那个无限憧憬的未来吗？\n数字时代法则\n最后，讲一讲数字时代法则。\n工业时代的关键词是物质化生产和稀缺性。任何生产与需求之间的矛盾就产生了稀缺性。\n在信息时代，信息的复制、分享的边际成本为零。在一个规模化社区中，效能与社区规模成正比，而边际成本为零——你可以想象这其中的信息和经济落差，以及带来的经济效益。\n这种新的互联时代经济学法则在迅速地接管旧的经济学法则——如果从古登堡经济学开始计算，前者花了500年，而后者，如Facebook，花了10年时间。\n在工业时代经营的关键词是：垄断、保密、圈地、竞争；在信息时代的关键词是：开放、分享、透明。\n组建属于你的社区，链接尽可能多的人、信息或节点，分享你了解的所有信息，让信息迅速地通过你这个节点，并且不断扩大属于你或经过你的信息和社区规模，这是在信息互联时代聪明人应该做的事情。\n我们仍不能确知这个时代将为我们带来的美好未来是什么，但我们确知它另我们无限憧憬，并将会为我们带来无限的自由。\n转发\n小熊猫\n小熊猫\n2019-10-28

威客就是wit(智慧)和key(钥匙)两个单词的组合，也是Thekeyofwisdom的缩写，是指那些通过互联网把自己的智慧、知识、能力、经验转换成实际收益的人，他们在互联网上通过解决科学、技术、工作、生活、学习中的问题，从而让自己的知识、智慧、经验、技能体现出经济价值。\n随后就有公司迅速地进行了各种商业模式的探索。但第一代威客网站，如猪八戒、威客网选择的任务分配机制却将自己仅仅变为一个C2C的中介平台。在这些网站上，工作按照不同领域分类，明码标价，用悬赏模式应对低端任务，用招标模式应对中高端任务，工作一旦认领就由单个用户完成，奖金也全部由其独得。网站靠每单成交的佣金抽成和广告获利。\n经过几年的发展，这种简单解决需求与认知盈余之间信息鸿沟问题的中介平台已经无法体现群体协作、累积认知盈余的力量，反而陷入了像门户网站拼流量的怪圈。\n此外，他们的大量用户并不是在为协作完成某个任务而努力，而是将时间花在了挑选一个或多个任务上，并且单个用户完成的任务，质量难以保证；或者由众多用户投稿，最后竞标成功者得，又会导致极大的人工浪费。在这种情势下，新形态的协作平台呼之欲出。\n在北京西长安街边的一幢老旧居民楼里，“做到！”网的创业团队就在一套狭小的两居室内办公，这是创始人之一、CEO刘禹的住所，被临时改成办公室。其中一间屋子里六位工程师各自对着电脑忙碌，墙上挂着一只来自宜家的表，表大得出奇，和逼仄的空间形成鲜明反差。另外一间卧室兼办公室则放着刘禹的苹果笔记本，连接着一台大尺寸显示器。这个创业团队每天工作15个小时，每天的晚饭或者夜宵是他们最大的放松与娱乐。\n“在想到和得到之间还需要做到才行，所以我们为这个工作平台取了这个名字。”刘禹起初创立“做到！”网只是因为对现代企业的工作方式不认可，“每天朝九晚五的固定工作时间，和工作效率几乎无关，再加上浪费在路上的时间，非常不高效。在互联网时代，人们可以也应该有更为优化、合理的工作方式”。\n做到，得到\n如何更为充分利用每个人的认知盈余并实现报酬的公平分配，是这个新型协作平台想要突破的难关。“做到！”网想到的点子是，利用算法首先将庞杂的工作整体“炸开”，形成一般只需要三五分钟的极为短小的任务单位，然后推荐给相应的用户。\n每个用户登录后所看到的并不是开放货架式可供挑选的工作，而是自己的“工作台”，每个用户在选择任务类型后看到的都只是碎片化的任务。这些微任务除了工作量适合闲暇时间完成外，还会在用户工作的过程中提供各种参考，帮助用户更加高效高质地完成工作。刘禹主要瞄准的用户群是二三线城市的白领人士，因为“他们综合素质很好，但他们拥有的机会和工作环境却往往不如一线城市的白领”。\n同时，为了管控任务完成质量，“做到！”还设置了一系列质量审核规则和用户质量追踪系统。如果你的质量好，系统就会采纳；质量不好，系统就会把工作再转给其他人，而质量好坏是由用户和系统交叉评估而成。这种听起来复杂的机制不但能鼓励用户评论其他人的工作成果并产生积极互动，还能帮助他们提升自己的技能。\n这种机制由此大大提高了效率，每个人所贡献的脑力劳动在最终的工作成果中都有所体现，并且任务一旦达标，就不会再浪费用户的劳动。而更令“做到！”网感到骄傲的是越为庞杂的工作完成的相对速度会越快，并且质量会更高。\n目前，还没有正式开放注册的“做到！”网已经吸引到了多家投资机构的注意，但刘禹认为不能为了融资而融资，应该沉下心打好产品基础，步步为营。他说：“初创公司最大的敌人不是竞争对手而是自己，没有准备好的扩张就是拔苗助长。”\n仅半年的创业历程已经让刘禹变成了业务多面手，但商务拓展对他来说仍是亟须解决的问题。作为一个更像B2C的协作工作平台，“做到！”从甲方公司拿到订单后，通过一系列技术手段分发并确保任务在规定时间内完成，然后通过赚取佣金形成赢利。\n目前，“做到！”网的技术研发强项还是在人工协作的流程管控上，但对上游资源的开发还有一定局限性。据刘禹透露，后续会根据客户需求拓展工种，更好地服务于甲方并丰富用户的任务选择。\n“做到！”网正在苦练的，是利用算法管控任务的完成质量，以及为用户推荐与之相匹配的任务类型。留学硅谷、日本归来的工程师正在用一种更为聪明的方法管理不确定性极强的事件——令陌生用户完成缺乏统一标准的脑力劳动。方法之一就是通过每个用户的行为记录及分析，使得用户的认知面目变得更加清晰。\n刘禹打趣地说：“‘做到！’在帮助传统企业变得越来越轻，因为有越来越多的业务可以交付给专业的协作平台完成。”而现实中“做到！”却变得越来越重，因为业务需要，他们已经在寻找新的办公地点，“我们的愿望是‘做到！’的办公室里最终没有人，大家可以在任何地点工作。”\n如今，当企业边界变得越来越模糊，甚至成为无边界组织的同时，不少新问题也在浮现：一个单靠用户热情而没有商业契约的协作平台该如何保证其成果的稳定质量？如何持续激发用户的创造与分享热情？更为严峻的问题是，利用个体认知盈余创造出来的智慧财富该如何估值，其商业模式是否能够走得通？\n问问知乎\n虽然有着像李开复、洪波等互联网领域的公众人物和超级链接者，2011年1月底低调上线的社交化问答网站知乎也面临着同样的问题。知乎也是充分利用认知盈余的一个例证，只不过它采取的是问答方，并且对用户没有任何物质奖励。然而在知乎上，就有人问出了这样的问题——“知乎如何解决赢利的问题呢？”答案有4个；而另外一个更为标题党的提问得到了24个答案——“知乎如果不能实现赢利的话，还能维持多久？”\n在回答这个问题之前，我们有必要先了解一下互联网世界的知识组织形式和生产方式。而Google为此做了很好的注释，就在今年4月，Google——这个将“组织世界上的信息，使其便于大众获取和使用”视为己任的搜索巨擘做了一个改变，将其搜索部门更名为知识部门(KnowledgeGroup)。而GoogleCEO拉里？佩奇(LarryPage)对于更名的解释是，“搜索引擎的目标可能不只是组织信息那么简单。寻找一条帮助人们分享和创造知识的途径，才是我们的首要目标”。\n而知乎也意识到，拥有一定规模的用户在一起实时编辑知识是基本，走推荐引擎的商业模式才是正道，当他们积累到一定数据量就可以匹配广告、对接电子商务。比如知乎上有人问“Lamy这个牌子的笔好在哪儿？”侧栏就可以放置Lamy的广告和网店链接。\n但对于知乎的用户而言，他们尽管没有物质回报，但他们得到的是人与人之间的鼓励，以及从创造中获得的成就感。知乎有一位深度用户，在他做实习律师的时候，就因为喜欢整理网上的资料而且懂得用高级搜索，为一个大案子找到了判例，因此在官司赢了之后，他成为律所里的“技术天才”。后来，同事们纷纷把最难查的问题抛给他来搜。当他几年前从这个律所离职时，大律师说，你走不要紧，但你要把搜索的技能教给同事们。但是教了几个月，他发现还是他的搜索结果最好最准确，因为他不断在解决越来越复杂的问题，因此他的搜索资料库越积累越丰富，方法越来越灵活。他最后总结了一句话：“你被问得越多，你就越聪明。”\n这位律师创造知识的首要目的并不是为了分享，而是他发现被问得越多越聪明，另外当有一定的知识积累量后，还能做知识管理，分享只是这个过程的副产品。\n知乎有不少这样的用户——他们不用微博、不写博客、不混开心网豆瓣网、不用聊天工具，如果不是因为寻找一些专业知识，你在网络上根本找不到这些人。\n而这几乎成了知乎活跃用户的共性——在其他互联网社交工具上极度不活跃，知乎目前三个答题过千的用户都有这个特征。\n而这些人可能就是改变未来知识创造方式的排头兵，也是他们最先享受到这种方式带来的种种好处。这就像印刷业一样，即便它的追求那么崇高，而首先出现的印刷品却是黄色小说；也正如3D技术的普及一样，是色情电影加快了它进入家庭的进程。而人类对认知盈余的利用，也需要首先尝到它带来的甜头，无论是一些微小的物质奖励还是极大的心理满足，毕竟未来人们要越来越习惯这种全新的知识生产、创造与分享方式。\n案例2：同病相怜共同体\n文/克莱？舍基\n“同病相怜”网用户的观念正在发生重要的转变：从一种医务人员持有信息并且不让病人知道的文化规范，转变到一种分享且人人受益的规范。\n让我们想象一位患上复杂到足以改变其生活的疾病的病人，这样的病患需要专业医生为他诊断治疗，但他也希望对医生所进行的治疗有更多了解，但医生却没有时间向病人提供他想知道的所有信息。在这种情况下，人类互动中产生的两种价值—分享和归属感—便能够脱颖而出，而几年前这两种价值根本没有机会一展身手。\nPatientsLikeMe.com(同病相怜)这个网站，正如其网站名所说的那样，让患有相同慢性病的病友分享信息、提供帮助。加入这个网站的组群正好与美国当前医疗保健体系的交互作用模式相吻合：病友之间可以互相学习如何应对长期或复杂的治疗，了解对帕金森病的深度脑刺激治疗法、艾滋病的抗病毒治疗法等，可以让自己作为医学研究人员的实验病人，这样不仅可以降低治疗费用，还可以加快测试新疗法、疗效的进度。\n抱团取暖\n传统的新疗法实验通常是在不足20个病人组成的特殊实验小组中进行，而超过5万人在使用“同病相怜”网为特殊疾病创建了组群，结果访问这个网站的肌萎缩性侧索硬化症(简称ALS，也称作卢？格里格病)患者非常多，他们甚至把讨论区细化为普通的肌萎缩性侧索硬化症和两种更罕见的变异—原发性侧索硬化(PLS)和进行性肌萎缩(PMA)。\nALS会影响到大脑和脊髓中所有的运动神经元，PLS只影响上位运动神经元，而PMA只影响下位运动神经元。这种区别很重要，因为从发病开始，ALS患者的平均存活率在25年之间，PLS患者为510年，PMA患者则能存活10年以上。医学研究界对PLS和PMA的了解甚少，虽然ALS也很罕见(约只有十万分之一的人可能患上这种疾病)，但它比PLS和PMA要常见20倍。关于PLS或PMA患者的最大规模研究，检查的病人也不会超过50位，而在“同病相怜”网站上注册的PLS病人有近200名，PMA病人则接近300名。\n“同病相怜”网站上的病人不仅仅是把自己当做药物试验的“小白鼠”，他们还分享治疗经验，比如怎么应付复杂的给药方案，分享如何与整个卫生保健系统打交道，他们还提供一种很少有医生能做到的支持：与同病相怜者交谈。\n“同病相怜”可以用“共同体”这个词来代替，以指代那些具有特定情况的病患群体。和任何实践团体一样，他们分享信息和观点，建立起彼此支持的文化规范，他们提供一定程度上的道德支持，这是现有医疗体系很少能做到的，但这又被证明是治疗的关键之一。撇开任何身体上的改善，患者能知道自己并不是唯一一个承受这种疾病折磨的人，这本身对他们而言，就是巨大的宽慰。再加上他们还能在这里得到关于发病症状、治疗、发病征兆等方面的信息。在“同病相怜”网，病友想问什么问题，就可以创建什么样的论坛主题。\n其中，一些对治疗计划的讨论非常具体。一位病人提到他让自己的神经病医生改变巴氯芬的服用剂量，这个药是用来治疗“足下垂”的。这位患者的神经病科医生跟他说10毫克已经是每天的最大剂量了，他如此服药了14年，但收效甚微。后来，在“同病相怜”网上，他了解到一些和自己有同样情况的病友服用巴氯芬的剂量达到每天80毫克，并且没有产生任何副作用。他将这一信息告诉了自己的医生，医生给他增加了剂量，效果很好。\n建立分享与开发的文化规范\n此外，“同病相怜”网收集病人数据的方式比传统方式更好，因为它提供给病患一种归属感和共同努力的感觉。病人数据质量的提高是因为这里的交流对话能帮助成千上万的人，这个吸引了更多人访问并会再次光顾。在“同病相怜”网上的ALS病人不仅从病友那里得到了从专业医生那儿得不到的帮助，同样提供医生都无法得到的信息。\n“同病相怜”网之所以能发挥作用，是因为它的成员珍视医疗数据的开放与分享，这是一种与主流医疗隐私规范相反的文化规范。尽管和大多数处理用户数据的网站一样，“同病相怜”网也有隐私条约，但它也有自身的开放理念。由于隐私条例和专有策略，目前在美国健康保健数据是无法访问的，这导致医学研究进展缓慢，突破性治疗方法通常要等上几十年，因此患者无法得到相关信息做出重要的治疗决定。但是当你和成千上万同病相怜的人分享疾病信息时，就等于开放了卫生保健系统，你可以知道什么对别人起作用，你与医生的谈话将如何更有效，最重要的是，专业人士能在最短时间内将更好的治疗方案带进市场。\n“同病相怜”网提供了很多有趣的分享工具。分享其实是人类的天性，并非是由科技催生出来的。如今，“同病相怜”网用户的观念正在发生重要的转变：从一种医务人员持有信息并且不让病人知道的文化规范，转变到一种分享且人人受益的规范。在这里，病人不仅受益于情感上的彼此连接，还受益于分享彼此的忧虑苦痛、亲身观察和症状表现等；研究者们受益于得到了患有慢性及罕见疾病的最大患者群体。“同病相怜”网使得病人和医生能够一起重新整合、创造更多信息。\n“同病相怜”一旦成功就会改变整个健康保健数据出于保护隐私被封闭起来的文化规范。这种文化规范的转换实际上并非毫无阻碍。“同病相怜”网恰恰需要开放的理念，因为分享医疗信息有风险—从让人感到尴尬到职业歧视，再到恶意骚扰，而让人们接受这种风险的一个办法就是增加回报。如果有足够的人加入进来，使得这个分享与开放的新群体看起来有价值和意义，那么就会鼓励更多的人加入进来。这条正反馈回路会增加网站上医疗信息的总体价值。\n如今，“同病相怜”网在美国名声大噪，每十个被诊断出患ALS的病人中就有一个会成为这里的新成员。这些病人不仅愿意接受开放的理念，他们中的一些人还同意捐出自己的整个基因序列供研究使用。\n“同病相怜”网阐明了我们在面对社交媒介时所面对的最重要问题之一—我们在多大程度上愿意利用认知盈余创造真正的公民价值。\n互联网新时代的晨光\n文/马化腾\n不管已经出现了多少大公司，人类依然处于互联网时代的黎明时分，微微的晨光还照不亮太远的路。在这个行当里，不管一家公司的赢利状况有多么喜人，也都随时面临着被甩出发展潮流的风险。\n最近读了两本克莱？舍基(ClayShirky)的书。第一本是《未来是湿的》，《认知盈余》是第二本。克莱？舍基不愧为“互联网革命最伟大的思考者”，他对互联网给人类所带来的行为举止以及文化变迁洞若观火。这两本著作一脉相承，它们所探讨的是这样几个问题：随着全球用户接触互联网的门槛变得越来越低，互联网用户数量变得更加庞大，他们将形成什么样的社会形态？我们又该如何顺应这种变化？而作为互联网的从业者，该如何从中寻找自己的机会？\n克莱？舍基应该是一个坚定的“分享主义”倡导者。如果说《未来是湿的》告诉我们世界正在进入一个分享的世界，人人都在享受分享所带来的“红利”；那么《认知盈余》是在进一步阐述我们得以分享的资源禀赋。\n任何时候，人们都不缺乏分享的欲望，为什么克莱？舍基会把它作为一个重点问题来研究？这得益于互联网所带来的技术革命，用通俗的话来说，就是“天时、地利、人和”都具备了。\n首先是天时。互联网的高速运算、处理能力，让每个业者得以能高效、快速地完成自己的工作。这意味着，每个人可以享受更多工作之外的时间；\n其次是地利。通讯成本的下降、带宽的增加，让用户接触互联网的成本变得更加低廉，网络不再是少数精英群体的专利，它像水和电一样，成为人们生活的必需品；\n最后是人和。接触成本的降低，不可避免地使得互联网用户呈现爆发式增长，网民和现实生活中的人群，二者的边界变得越来越模糊。正如克莱？舍基所言，“对网络的传统看法认为它是一个独立的空间，一个有别于现实世界的虚拟空间……而现在，越来越多的人使用电脑和智能手机，虚拟信息空间的整个概念都在退化”。\n网络世界越来越接近于现实世界，意味着基于这个概念建立起来的互联网商业模式将要重新架构。\n我曾经说过，不管已经出现了多少大公司，人类依然处于互联网时代的黎明时分，微微的晨光还照不亮太远的路。在这个行当里，不管一家公司的赢利状况有多么喜人，也都随时面临着被甩出发展潮流的风险。\n发展潮流的漩涡正在席卷我们，网络正在发生演变。过去，我们可以把网络解读为一种精英享用的新兴工具，它向用户提供的是接触传统精英文化的一个更加便捷的通道，也就是说互联网是内容的传递者而不是生产者。现在则不同，每个人都可以成为内容的生产者，互联网作为一个社会形态的元素，正在为社会源源不断地输出新的内容、制造新的话题。\n“认知盈余”是新时代网民赋予互联网从业者最大的红利之一。对“认知盈余”，克莱？舍基给出的定义很简单，就是受过教育并拥有自由支配时间的人，他们有丰富的知识背景，同时有强烈的分享欲望。可以说，Facebook、推特以及维基百科的成功，都是“认知盈余”的功劳。在中国，微博的兴起，同样有赖于它。\n参与分享的网民数量越来越多，力量越来越强大，互联网产业也随之迎来“核聚变”，原来我们所熟知的商业模式，随时可能成为泡影。每一个从业者必须认识到，如果你不能学会主动迎接，不对这种网民自由参与分享的精神保持敬畏之心，你就会被炸得粉碎。\n一个新的互联网时代即将到来。这将是一个鼓励分享、平台崛起的时代。靠单一产品赢得用户的时代已过去，渠道为王的传统思维不再吃香，在新的时代，如果还背着这些包袱，那就等于给波音787装了一个拖拉机的马达，想飞也飞不起来。如何铸造一个供更多合作伙伴共同创造、供用户自由选择的平台，才是互联网新时代从业者需要思考的问题。这个新时代，不再信奉传统的弱肉强食般的“丛林法则”，它更崇尚的是“天空法则”。所谓“天高任鸟飞”，所有的人在同一天空下，但生存的维度并不完全重合，麻雀有麻雀的天空，老鹰也有老鹰的天空。决定能否成功、有多大成功的，是自己发现需求、主动创造分享平台的能力。\n在这个平台上，用户将是内容的主导者、分享的提供者。每个用户的知识贡献、内容分享，是这个平台赖以成功、赖以繁荣的重要保障—“少数人使用廉价的工具，投入很少时间和金钱，就能在社会中开拓出足够的集体善意，创造出5年前没人能够想象的资源”。任何有意打破这个保障的行为，都将受到市场的惩罚。\n从去年年底开始，我就一直在思考，如何能将腾讯打造成一个供更多合作伙伴自由创业、供更多用户自由分享的开放平台。这是一个摸着石头过河的过程，它需要腾讯内外都改变心态，用更加开放的大脑去迎接变革。这段时间以来，我们已经拥有了一些经验，也总结了很多教训。无论如何，我相信，这是一条正确的道路，我也相信，坚持走下去，互联网新时代的晨光就在不远的前方。\n最后，我想说的一点感慨是：互联网真是个神奇的东西。最近在一部科幻小说中，我看到一段对于“四维世界”的描写，仅在熟知的三维世界上叠加了一个维度，整个宇宙立即变得无比辽阔、无比美妙。克莱？舍基的每一次发现，其实都是在提示我们未来人类世界的一个全新发展维度。在互联网的推动下，整个人类社会都变成了一个妙趣无穷的实验室。我们这一代人，每个人都是这个伟大实验的设计师和参与者。这个实验，值得我们屏气凝神心怀敬畏、全情投入。\n新社会契约\n文/赵嘉敏\n信息时代的剩余价值生产实际上就是认知剩余的解放。这样一个开启新时代的基本要素和驱动力，又怎能不与经济和商业现象发生互动呢？\n坦白说，我并没有读过克莱？舍基的《认知盈余》(CognitiveSurplus)这本书(我认为“认知剩余”的译法会更好些，并会在后文一直使用这一提法)，只是去年在东西网站上看过他演讲的翻译，当时觉得里面谈到的有关契约的例子很有意思，还跟公共管理专业毕业的夫人讨论了一番。那个例子通过一组生动且引人深思的社会行为学实验，论证了经济上的契约—譬如罚款这种形式—无助于人们社会意识或公民意识的建立，甚至有时候还会起到相反的作用。在演讲中，克莱？舍基又通过两个网站的例子—一个允许人们上传和分享猫咪有趣瞬间的照片，另一个则允许人们在地图上报告和标注新闻事件，提出他的观点：今天，人们借助认知剩余来改变世界的条件已经具备了。这两个条件是：人类自古以来就具有的、内在的创造、奉献和分享的意愿；网络作为新的工具，能够将人们大量空闲时间所蕴含的丰富认知力发掘出来，并通过协作的方式完成许多创新实验。基于这个，克莱？舍基进一步呼吁，人们应该引导认知剩余更好地贡献于更有意义的、可以用来改变社会的事业。\n从公益到商业\n克莱？舍基是一名学者，他观察社会，从一个学者的责任感，同时也是他内在的社会契约出发，从公益到商业总结社会现象，洞察社会趋势，升华出指导社会行为的理论。他的理论和观点具有高度的概括性和普适性。\n但另一方面，克莱？舍基在演讲时的表述给人以认知剩余和商业契约难以兼容的错觉，而这恐怕是对认知剩余理论体系的最大损害。阿尔文？托夫勒在30年前出版的《第三次浪潮》一书，在这部经典著作中，托夫勒预见性地指明了人类社会从工业时代向信息时代转变的趋势和方向。如果说工业时代是建立在两次工业革命及剩余价值(SurplusValue)生产的基础上的话，那么信息时代则必然是以认知剩余为其根本，或者换句话说，信息时代的剩余价值生产实际上就是认知剩余的解放。\n这样一个开启新时代的基本要素和驱动力，又怎能不与经济和商业现象发生互动呢？\n西方社会经过工业革命以来近150年的发展，已经进入了一个相对富足的阶段。在这样的社会中，公民价值、社会责任在人们的意识中有时会置于经济利益之前，特别是对于那些受过良好教育、收入稳定的中产阶级人群来说，更是如此，而这个人群，也恰恰是蕴含最丰富认知剩余的人群。因此在西方社会，认知剩余的发掘最初并不带有明显的商业元素，而是更多地突出社会价值和个人满足感，然后再向商业领域渗透。IT技术上的开源运动正是经历了这样一个过程。\n而在中国则不同。我们用短短30年的时间试图完成西方150年的工业革命历程，并与西方同步进入信息时代。在这样一个特殊时期，社会和人群对于财富和成功的渴望极其强烈，中产阶级意识仍只是一个萌芽，既小且脆弱，社会行为和现象很难摆脱过于逐利和过于急迫的阴影。在这样一个社会，认知剩余的发掘不可避免地从一开始就打上了商业的烙印，但这并不一定是件坏事。日本在二战后的崛起正是因为它同时完成了第一次和第二次工业革命，抓住了变革的机遇。今天，中国正在面对一个更大的机遇。\n如果把“第三次浪潮”看做一个预言，那么“认知剩余”就是支撑这个预言的理论体系中的核心概念，而“众包(Crowdsourcing)”则是让预言和理论变为现实的可操作模式一。在“众包”这样一个可操作模式中，我们所要解决的核心问题就包括了克莱？舍基所提到的契约关系—包括商业契约关系和社会契约关系，以及企业与社区一体化的组织结构变革。\n“众包”在中国的实践形成了两个分支：一种是通过社区贡献者的创作来生产内容，并给予其中佼佼者以物质回报的社区和内容网站；一种是为需求方和服务提供者(往往是个体的自由职业者)提供中介平台的威客网站。后者以明确的三方商业契约关系为基础，将认知剩余和物质回报直接挂钩，可以看做是“众包”的一种极端形式。\n东西网和译言网就是通过社区译者的工作将互联网上的优质外文内容翻译成中文，以飨中国读者的小众社区和内容网站。小众的好处是，我们可以在这样一个规模的社区平台上进行一些深入的探索和尝试。\n译言网创办于2006年7月，最初是一个翻译类博客网站，后来改写为一个开放的Web2.0平台，有兴趣的用户都可以在上面翻译和发表国外网站上的内容。译言网是最早将“长尾理论”较为完整地介绍给中文读者的网站。2008年5月，汶川地震发生后，译言网通过近600名译者的协作，在不到两周的时间里翻译出了《地震救灾手册》等10余万字的资料。早期的译言网更多的带有公益色彩，体现了社区译者们分享的意愿和乐趣以及由此带来的社会价值。\n2009年5月，译言网与英国《卫报》合作，开办了《卫报》中文版子站。经由这个项目，译言网开始对社区译者的工作给予物质回馈。但直到今天，译言社区的绝大部分译者的工作动机都是出于兴趣、分享等非物质回报，而不是物质回报。\n从商业契约到社会契约\n与《卫报》的合作也促使译言网更深入地思考和探索满足商业需求的组织结构。经过半年的探索，一个由社区译者组成的底层平行网络叠加由编辑团队组成的上层引导和控制的层级架构逐渐浮现出来。2009年12月，我们创办的东西网延续了对这种层级架构的探索和实践，并且发现在互联网环境下，这种两层的层级架构出乎意料的有效和实用，不仅能够满足商业项目的质量要求，还大大加快了项目进程，并且还会浮现出一些意想不到的创新。《连线》杂志创始主编凯文？凯利写于1994年的经典著作《失控》正是用这种模式翻译出来的，协作的十几位译者为译本增添了400多个注解。借助这种模式，东西网不但为福布斯中文网站提供翻译服务，还承接了小布什自传及乔布斯唯一官方传记等重要外版图书的翻译工作。\n东西网也在社区回馈上进行了一些尝试，包括为一些社区译者提供物质激励，以孵化出一些高质量的内容专栏。通过这些尝试我们发现，译者的非物质动机是与可以获取的物质回报成反比的，也与受到的自上而下的引导成反比。换句话说，网站的引导意志越强，需要给予社区的物质激励就越多，社区的自发性也越弱。这正是克莱？舍基演讲时宣称的认知剩余与商业契约间存在的冲突和矛盾。\n这种冲突和矛盾从另一个角度说明了为什么在信息时代扁平的组织结构更有活力。认知剩余的发掘度与层级数目的增加成反比，层级越多，组织中处于底层的人群(往往也是数目最大的人群)受契约的约束就越大，可以认为组织中的契约关系是自上而下层层传递和叠加的，其认知剩余就越难于发掘出来。\n在组织内部的契约关系需要弱化的同时，另一种契约则需得到加强—这就是每个贡献者的内在社会契约意识，也就是克莱？舍基所谈到的人类自古以来的创造、奉献和分享的意愿。这种契约意识是个体内在的控制环路，从控制系统的角度类来说，它比任何外部控制环路都要灵敏和迅捷，因此这种契约意识的强化，可以最大限度地激发出个体的认知剩余，从而产生最完美的结果。\n也因此，克莱？舍基在演讲结束部分提到，认知剩余带来的是前所未有的新的组织模式，尽管他在这点上有些语焉不详。但回顾学者们从“第三次浪潮”到“认知剩余”到“众包”所构建起来的理论链条，以及我们对“众包”模式的实践和尝试，其内在的逻辑连接已经呼之欲出，一幅未来的图景也在我们眼前逐渐清晰起来：\n在互联网时代，企业与社区的边缘被打破，扁平化及网络化的组织结构使经营者与生产者之间的商业(也许还有法律)契约关系被弱化，企业在利用社区的认知剩余创造价值和获得利润并与社区合理分享利润的同时，也通过某些非物质的方式回馈社区，为个体的社会契约意识的培养和加强提供正反馈。在这样的双重作用下，人类的认知剩余得到极大解放，创造出更加灿烂的物质文明和精神文明。\n这，该是一个多么和谐的社会呀\n文/克莱？舍基\n由于网络的发明和扩散，使得以前被排除在外的普通民众能够利用自由时间从事自己喜欢\nWhitelabel

surplus），也就是人们的自由时间，或称空闲时间，它是一种工业化的副产品。19世纪后期，随着工业化的普及，人口总数和社会生产总值越来越高，在工作之余，人们有了更多可以自由支配的时间。\n由于选择较少，绝大多数情况下人们都把自由时间“消费”在看电视上了。电视上播出的各种娱乐节目，侵吞了发达国家公民的大量自由时间。看电视几乎成了发达国家市民的第二职业。\n“看电视就消耗掉了我们最大部分的自由时间：全世界的人们平均每周花在看电视上的时间超过20小时。”\n人们常常为了看电视而将其他活动推到一边，而电视的消极作用之一便是——减少了人与人之间接触的时间。也有相当多的研究表明，看电视过多是造成人们不快乐的原因之一。另一方面，电视又助长了我们的物欲和实利主义，使我们低估了人际关系给生活带来的满足感和重要性，导致我们过多地从事那些能产生收益的活动。\n“正是由于看太多的电视使我们将更多的精力转而投入到物质满足上，因此花在社交方面的时间就减少了。”\n美国人一年花在看电视上的时间约为2000亿小时，这几乎是2000个维基百科项目每年研发所需的时间。每个周末，人们都会花约1亿小时看电视……\n想象一下，如果我们将全世界受教育公民的自由时间看成一个集合体，也就是一种认知盈余（cognitive surplus），那么，这种盈余会有多大？\n我们所处时代的不凡之处在于，我们现在可以将自由时间当作是一种普遍的社会资产，用于大型的共同创造的项目，而不再是个人的零碎时间。\n微小的选择是一种个人行为，而庞大的选择则是一种集体行为，是数以百万计的微小选择的集合。比如，正是由于整个人群中不断积累的对参与态度的转变，才使得维基百科的产生成为了可能。\n一位英国学者曾在报告中指出，一位电视主管人员告诉他，年轻人的分享行为会随着他们的长大而逐渐消失，因为工作会耗费他们太多精力，以至于他们回家后的空闲时间只能是“瘫在电视前”。轻信“这种行为过去稳定，因此将来也会稳定”是错误的——这不仅是错误，而且构成了一种特殊的错误。我们可以通过以下的“奶昔错误”，发现我们错在哪里。\n麦当劳曾想提高一款奶昔的销量，因此找来了专业的研究员来调查顾客最喜欢什么样的奶昔。结果该调查员却发现，奶昔在早上的销量更好。这显然违反了一般人的思维——奶昔不该出现在“早餐”中啊？顾客为什么会在早上八点钟买奶昔？\n经过调查发现，人们要在早上开车时进食，就只能用一只手吃东西，它不能太油腻，不能太烫，不能洒到哪儿都是，又必须可口……没有任何一种传统早餐能够满足这些要求，因此，人们会选择奶昔，因为它相对符合我们的要求，所以人们也就不再考虑什么才是“传统早餐”。\n“奶昔错误”（milkshake mistakes）有两层含义：\n第一个错误是，人们只关注了产品本身，而没有考虑到顾客（受众）的角色，以及顾客的需求（他们的目标与动机）。\n第二个错误是，人们对早餐观念的理解太狭隘了，仿佛人类所有习惯都是根深蒂固的传统，而不是积累起来的偶然事件（其实小到个人的选择，大到人类历史的发展，都可能是积累起来的偶然事件）。\n联想到“媒体”，我们也面临同样的问题。就像作者克莱·舍基说的：\n“当我们谈起网络和短信的作用时，我们很容易犯‘奶昔错误’，我们只会关注工具本身。我这么说是根据我的自身经验，20世纪90年代我开展了大量关于电脑和互联网性能的研究，却很少考虑到其实是人类的欲望塑造了它们。”\n人们对社会科技的使用很少是由工具本身来决定的。\n“当我们使用网络时，最重要的是我们获得了同他人联系的接口。我们想和别人联系在一起，这是一种电视无法替代的诉求，但实际上我们可以通过使用社会化媒体来满足它。”\n如今，当少数的人使用廉价的工具，投入很少的时间和金钱时，就能在社会中开拓出足够多的集体善意，创造出前人所不能想象的资源。\n例如，2007年底，一个叫做Ushahidi的服务平台上线，用于干预肯尼亚居民所面临的种族暴力。它能自动收集群众的报道，将所有个人身边发生的暴力冲突事件，编织成了一幅全国性的画面。它使人们充分利用大量的集体信息变得容易，使得人人都可以轻松了解、提供、参与、收集暴力事件信息。\n和许多有意义的事一样，我们从中可以发现一些规律：\n●　人们想做一些事情来让世界变得更美好。\n●　当人们受到邀请时，愿意伸出援手。\n●　在尝试新的事物时，使用简单灵活的工具可以排除很多困难。\n●　如果你想充分利用认知盈余，一部手机就足够了。\n而更加重要的是：\n“一旦你弄明白如何通过一种让他人在意的方式来充分利用认知盈余，那么他人也会复制你的技术，一而再、再而三地传遍世界。”\n虽然平庸和优秀之间确实有着天壤之别，但是在创造的范围内，你可以通过累积将平庸变成优秀。因为真正的鸿沟就在于“做点什么”和“什么都不做”之间。我们也必须认识到：再愚蠢的创造，都是一种创造。\n“和别人一起创造并分享某样事物，这一简单的举动至少代表了对某种旧有文化模型的回应，而这种文化模型现在正披着科技的外衣。”\n2．多即是不同\n2008年，作者克莱·舍基的《未来是湿的》一书出版之后，他接受一位电视制片人的采访，当被问到“你认为目前社会化媒体有哪些有趣的用处”时，克莱·舍基向她提起了维基百科，一部经互联网上众人协作完成的百科全书。他本以为这位制片人女士会就维基百科谈到关于知识的社会结构、权力的本质等等，然而让克莱·舍基吃惊的是，制片人却叹息道：“人们哪儿来的时间？”克莱·舍基立刻插话道：“别人可以问，但是做电视这一行的人绝对不能问这样的问题，你应该清楚那些时间是从哪儿来的。”因为这位制片人来自于一个在过去50年中消磨掉大多数公民大量自由时间的行业——电视媒介。\n19世纪末，人们为了谋求更好的工作环境而发起抗议活动，其中最受欢迎的工人口号是：“8小时工作，8小时睡觉，8小时做我们想做的事！”\n今天，我们有了自由时间，却将来之不易的大部分自由时间都花在了一些单一活动上，比如看电视。我们忘记了，我们是消费它，而不是被它消费。\n20世纪的媒体，作为一种单一事件发展着，这就是“消费”。但其实，媒介包含三项不同的活动：消费、创造、分享。\n人们喜欢这三种活动，但电视媒介却依然只回报了其中一种，也就是消费。\n电话是平衡的，我们消费（购买）了电话，也获得了创造。我们手中的电话不限制于只收听电话，还可拨打电话。\n电脑也是平衡的，我们消费了一台电脑，同时获得了可以创造内容的机器。我们能与朋友分享因电脑而产生的内容。\n而电视却是不平衡的，当我拥有一个电视台，你拥有一台电视机，那么我可以和你说话（传达），但你却无法和我说话。\n“日积月累的迹象表明，如果你为人们提供了创造和分享的机会，那么他们有时会和你辩论，即使他们此前从没有过那样的举动，即使他们对此并不像专业人士那样精通。这并不能说明我们将停止盲目地看电视，它仅仅说明了消费已经不是我们利用媒介的唯一方式。”\n应将我们的关注点从“消费”扩展到包括“创造”和“分享”。\n全世界的认知盈余太多了，多到即使微小的变化，都能积累成为巨大的后果。\n●　人们必须同心协力贡献自己的空余时间来创造认知盈余，而不仅仅是完成一系列微不足道且又彼此分离的个人行为。\n●　当群体足够大时，不可预知的可以变得可预知。\n●　任何人类活动，无论看上去多么不可能，在人群中发生的可能性都会增加。规模较大的盈余和小盈余就是不同。\n新的时代赋予了我们新的机遇，当某样东西积累了很多时，它将以新的形式来表现。新的媒介也一样，它正以一种空前的规模积累我们的“创造”和“分享”能力。\n试想，一个带着相机的人，遭遇一件全球性的大事件的可能性有多大？\n如果我们以自我为中心去思考，可能就会想：这几率能有多大？得到的答案也肯定是，很小，小到几乎不可能。\n“我们认识新媒介工具所带来的文化变革非常艰难的原因之一就在于，我们惯于以自我为中心（egocentric）看待事物，而这是错误的路径。”\n一个带着相机的人遭遇一件全球性大事件的可能性，是和事件的目击者人数，以及他们中带着相机的比例有关的。\n目击者人数会根据事件的不同而有不同数量的浮动；而带相机的人，自2000年的数百万人已经上升到了如今的超过10亿人，自从相机被植入到手机中后，这一数字又提升了带相机的人数。因此，我们才看到了更多的全球性大事件，如：2005年伦敦地铁恐怖袭击事件、2006年泰国政变、2008年奥克兰警察杀死黑人案……等等，这些事件被人们用相机或手机记录了下来并上传到了互联网，使能看到的人更多。\n规模数量上的变化，意味着曾经不可能的事情变成了可能，曾经不太可能的事情变成了肯定。因此，一个带着相机的人遭遇一件全球性大事件的可能性，已经变成了一个事件会有目击者看到的可能性。\n库尔特•冯内古特说过一句话：“人身上发生的最糟糕的事就是，他们对任何人和任何事都没有用处。”融合认知盈余，会让这种命运不太可能马上到来。\n过去我们依赖专业的媒体、新闻记者来记录这些事件，现在我们已经越来越多地成为了彼此的媒体、记者。\n媒介，正变成一种有组织的廉价而又全球适用的分享工具。\n3．认知盈余，一种全新的资源\n伴随全球受教育人口累积起来每年有超过一万亿小时的自由时间，以及公共媒介的发明和扩散，使我们有权使用认知盈余这种资源的最重要的两个转变已经产生。它使得从前被排除在外的普通市民，也能够利用自己的自由时间从事自己喜欢或者关心的活动。\n互联网使我们有机会将各自的自由时间积累，变成一种全球性资源。认知盈余只是一种可能，它本身不代表任何事物，也做不了任何事。为了了解我们能利用这一新资源来干什么，我们不仅要了解在哪里利用，还要知道如何利用。\n手段、动机和机会，能帮助我们解释社会上出现的新行为。\n“了解一件因为我们的认知盈余而变得可能的事情，意味着理解我们积累自由时间的方式、利用这种新型资源的动机以及我们事实上正在彼此创造的机会的本身。”\n认知盈余是我们只有通过集体才能去做的事，这是一个社会问题，而不仅仅是个人的事。\n“要想从共享的自由时间和才能中得到任何东西，我们必须彼此协作，因此利用认知盈余并不仅仅是个人喜好的堆积。”\n文化会决定我们从认知盈余中获得的价值有多少是公用的（communal），被人欣赏的，但对整体社会没太多用处的，而又有多少是公民的（civic）。\n从过去孤立的时间和才能中脱颖而出的认知盈余，仅仅是一种原材料，我们要从中获得价值，就必须让它变得有用或者能利用它做一些事。\n“我们大家并不仅仅是认知盈余的来源，也是设计它的使用方式的人，这种设计是通过参与，以及当我们以新的方式联系在一起时对彼此的期待而展开的。”\n二、工具赋予的可能性\n1．新方法，解决老问题\n如今，在网络平台上，人们在现实生活中原本可能稍纵即逝的对话得到了过去只有专业的媒体制作人才能享受的特质，那就是“可及性”和“永久性”。\n可及性是指一个人写的东西可以被一群人读到；永久性是指其所写出的作品可以一直存在。当人们接触了互联网之后，可及性和永久性都会增加。因为网络上的东西比电视上的东西更容易分享。\n社会化媒体工具不是现实生活的一个选项，而是现实生活的一部分，它已日益成为现实世界中应对突发事件的协调工具。\n“不仅社会化媒体在崭新的族群——也就是我们的手中有了新的一面，当沟通工具掌握在新的族群手中时，也会呈现出新的特点。”\n例如，解决上下班交通高峰问题的“合伙搭车”工具，它的关键不在于汽车本身，而是在于协调；市场也并不需要投入新的汽车，需要的仅仅是现有汽车的最新消息和使用情况。\n“当每个人都完全依靠自己的力量解决上下班高峰的拥堵问题时，办法只能是每个人买辆车自己开。然而这样的‘解决方式’无疑只能使问题雪上加霜。一旦我们把上下班高峰问题当作协调问题来看，我们便能想到不仅是一两个而且是一大堆解决办法。在合伙用车的情景中，马路上的汽车数量会演变成一种机会，因为每一辆有空位的汽车都有可能找到同路人。”\n那么“合伙搭车”工具，是如何利用社会化媒体的呢？它能够成功的秘诀是什么？\n●　它能循序为用户提供充足的信息，以解决用户现实生活中的问题。\n●　它摒除了网络媒体和“现实生活”的隔阂，通过一种琐碎的方式提供网络服务，通过把用户配对来创造价值。\n●　它创造了一种集合价值（aggregate value）。也就是说，用户越多，匹配的可能性就越大。\n“原有的逻辑，如电视逻辑，仅仅把观众当作个体的集合，每个个体都无法为彼此创造真正的价值。而数字媒体的逻辑则不同，它承认这些从前作为受众的人们每天都可以为彼此创造价值。”\n曾经，一个人想要发表文章是一件需要获得许可才能做的事，至少要取得出版方的准许。而现在，我们不再如此了，在互联网上，我们只需要按一下“发表”按钮就行了。\n然而“自由”和“品质”构成了两种相互矛盾的目标。印刷术普及后，尽管出版自由度增加了，但也确实降低了出版物的平均水平。\n“普通人出版图书越容易，出版图书的质量也就越一般，但参与公共讨论的自由度的增加多少会产生一些弥补价值。”\n好处就是实验的形式得到了拓展。尽管活字印刷术的广泛应用大大降低了印刷品的平均质量，但它同样刺激了小说、报纸和期刊的出现。\n“某一领域的成本降低意味着可以开展更多的实验，交流成本的降低意味着可以开展更多关于思维和表达的实验。”\n这种实验的能力同时也扩大了创作者的数量，并且使其多样化。\n就我们的认知而言，资源的匮乏比资源的丰富更容易解决。当某样东西越来越少时，我们只会比从前更加视其珍贵，这仅仅是一个概念上的小变化。\n“而丰富则不同：它的出现意味着我们可以开始像浪费一切廉价的东西一样去处理此前珍贵的东西，仿佛它们便宜得能被拿去做实验似的。”\n丰富的资源也可能改变我们曾经习以为常的平衡状态，甚至令我们迷失；匮乏的资源会让人觉得资源本身很珍贵，却不会考虑该资源的价值中有多少是因为资源稀缺造成的。\n例如在长途电话费降低后的很多年里，我们年长的亲戚们仍旧会在电话里不断示意“长途电话费贵”。长途电话曾经真的很贵，尽管长途电话费降低了，但人们花了很长的时间才明白：原来便宜的长途电话费和此前觉得长途电话费本身很贵的认识是无关的。\n在人们不断尝试创造新事物的过程中，自由不断增加，随之增加的还有劣质的材料，虽然人们尝试的目的是为了创造出广受赞誉的东西。\n“不断地尝试终究会带来回报，多样化的发展扩大了新的可能，其中最好的东西给我们带来了越来越好的作品。”\n2．媒体，社会的连接组织\n如果社会的变化很容易就被立即接受，那么它就称不上是革命。\n“革命集中在对业余爱好者融入生产者的震惊里，我们发表公共言论时不再需要借助专业人士的帮助和许可。”\n与我们曾经习以为常的媒体的基础概念大不相同：现在的我们不是在消费媒体，而是在利用媒体。\n媒体是什么？媒体既是指它本身这个行业，也是指它所制作的作品，还包括这些作品对社会的影响。\n“媒体是社会的连接组织（connective tissue）。”\n它让我们知道朋友的聚会在何时何地举行；让我们了解世界的另一端正发生着什么，那里的领导人是谁；让我们知道哪里可以买到真实且价格实惠的货品；让我们知道参加不了的会议都讨论了什么；让我们知道距离十几米之外有个什么人，或是什么样的服务……\n如今的数字网络，正不断增加着所有媒体的流动性（fluidity），使所有的媒体可以互相转化。\n“原本只能在单向公共媒体（如书籍和电影）和双向个人媒体（如电话）间进行的选择，如今扩展出了第三个选项：从个人到公众的可延展的双向媒体操作。”\n大家分享各自的作品、视频、心得，这些动机的背后并不是对金钱的渴望。\n那么人们又为什么要无偿劳动？\n●　因为分享照片、视频以及文章的人并没有期待回报，他们只是想要分享而已。\n●　另外一个更深层次的解释是：我们其实是在用一个专业媒体的概念来指代种种业余人士的行为；而非专业媒体人的出发点和专业人士的出发点有着本质上的不同。\n那些帮助我们分享的服务（或称平台、工具）之所以兴旺发达，是因为他们的服务能使我们原本就喜欢做的事操作起来变得更方便、快捷、便宜。\n“酒吧老板经营的奇妙之处在于他提供比他兜售的商品和服务更有价值的东西，他的价值是消费者自己为彼此创造的。人们愿意多花钱在酒吧喝酒而不在家独饮，是因为酒吧轻松的氛围更适合喝酒。”\n市场的作用之一，就是为我们在市场之外所专注投入的事情提供一个平台，这个平台的形式可以是酒吧，也可以是网站。\n“业余人士”并不是“专业人士”的缩小版，人们乐于做一些事，与有没有金钱利益无关。\n3．工具，赋予我们行为发生的可能\n媒体一直在不断演变，近半个世纪以来，媒体始终在收缩，但更年轻的人对媒体的了解还仅仅局限于信息量的不断丰富。\n正如作者克莱·舍基所说，他的学生们也许从来都不知道这个世界上曾经存在过这样一些媒体，以及由这样一些媒体构成的世界：电视里只有两三个频道，每当傍晚，观众唯一的选择就是观看电视上的白人用英语读报纸。\n尽管学生们不知道，但他们一定可以理解。因为媒体在不断发展，这种由稀缺到过剩的转变，我们始终在经历，即使今天，我们依然在经历这样一个过程。\n“当我告诉我的学生们普通群众的沉默都是装出来的时候，他们纷纷表示赞同。但即便他们能够从智力上明白那个世界，我仍旧可以感觉出来，他们对那个世界缺乏切身感受。他们从来都没有生活在不能公开发表言论的世界里，他们很难想象那样的世界与如今他们视为理所当然的参与行为的环境有何不同。”\n2005年7月，伦敦地铁和公交车发生爆炸后的几小时里，政府坚持认为是因为某种功率骤增而造成的设施损毁和人员伤亡。而当越来越多的人们在网络上看到地铁内部和双层公交顶盖被炸得粉碎的影像时，警局才公开承认此次爆炸是恐怖袭击。其实人们在政府还没表态的时候就已经开始去试图了解事情的真相了。此前，警局更多的选择是“我们要不要告诉公众点什么”，而到了2005年，却变成了“我们要不要成为公众谈话中的一部分”。\n“多年来人类少有动机上的变化，但是机会总是随着社会环境或多或少发生着变化。在机会变化小的世界里，行为的变化也就很小，但当机会有了大的变动，行为也会随之变化，只要这个机会诉诸了人类的真实动机。”\n对认知盈余的利用使人们得以用更慷慨、更开放、更加社会化的方式来表现自己，而不再保留自己原有的身份——比如用户和电视迷。这种变化的原材料是我们的“空闲时间”，但我们还拥有任由我们支配的工具，以及这些工具所提供给我们的新机遇。\n“并不是我们的工具塑造了我们的行为，但是工具赋予了我们行为发生的可能。”\n只有当新工具能够帮助人们做其想做的事情时，这个新工具才能够被积极利用起来。\n三、分享，无酬的动机\n1．热爱胜于金钱\n是什么促使人们为了没有明显回报的东西，而放弃了自己的时间和金钱？\n人类的动机并不纯粹是附加性的，为了兴趣而做事和为了报酬而做事，是截然不同的。\n人的动机可以分为两类：内在动机、外在动机。\n内在动机能让我们的行为本身就成为一种回报；而对外在动机来说，回报来自于行为之外，而不在于行为本身。\n“外在动机并不总是最有效的动机，增大外在动机可能降低内在动机。”\n像“得到报酬”这样的外在动机就能驱逐像“喜欢该事物本身”这样的内在动机，这被称为“驱逐效应”（crowding-out effect）。比如看电视驱逐了我们的社交活动，就是典型的驱逐效应。\n“1993年，布鲁诺·弗雷发现，当瑞士居民被问起，如果政府要在他们的生活区域里建造一座核废料贮藏库，他们是否会赞成该计划时，对这个问题的赞成和反对之声基本持平。当弗雷改述了这个问题，告诉他们如果建造废料贮藏库，那么政府可能给他们发放补贴时，民众态度反而变成了以三比一的比例反对这个计划。当建立废料贮藏库变成一种能获得政府补贴的行为，而不是一种公民义务时，这种行为不受欢迎的程度上升了两倍。”\n当钱用来作为志愿行为的回报时，会降低志愿者贡献平均劳动的时间。出发点是兴趣还是金钱，会让人们在做事情时表现得不一样。“若你支付报酬，人们就会被激励着去完成他们不感兴趣的任务。”\n内在动机分为两种：\n“自治的愿望（指决定我们做什么，怎么做）和有胜任感的愿望（指能够胜任我们所做的事）。”\n例如，在一个关于游戏的研究中表明，最吸引玩家的不是游戏中那些高仿真的画面和暴力场景，而是玩家在玩这个游戏的过程中能够控制并且有胜任它的感觉。\n所以当人们接手一项过于繁复庞大的工作时，会觉得让人泄气；但接受一项毫无挑战、过于简单的工作又会觉得无趣和无精打采。“胜任感”最容易产生于当工作处于能力范围边缘时，“我自己完成了一件较难的事”的感觉比“请专业人士帮我完成了一件事”的感觉要好得多。\n“自己创造的事物就算很普通，和消费别人创造的质量上乘的事物相比，它仍然有一种与众不同的吸引力。”\n2．业余动机和公共规模\n除了个人动机之外，还有一种我们只有在成为团体中的一员时，才能感觉到的动机，那就是社会动机。\n社会动机可分为宽泛的两类：一类围绕着联系和成员；另一类则围绕着分享和慷慨。\n哈佛大学的两位法学教授认定，社会动机能加强个人动机；我们的传播网络也鼓励新成员的加入和分享，因为两者无论从自身还是对外部来讲都是有益的，并且它们也能为自治和能力提供支持。\n在团体中，口头反馈似乎就像另一种外在的报酬，如同金钱一样。这个口头反馈可能是“你很棒”、“你比一般人厉害多了”等等。当它被真诚地表达出来，并且出自某个我们所尊敬的人之口时，它也成为了一种内在回报。\n在互联网组织中，人们彼此谈心、分享，归根结底，想要分享的动机才是驱动力，而技术仅仅是一种方法。\n除了以上的口头反馈，还有一种展现形式就是“感谢（致谢）”，无论它是出现在网站上，还是在书信中。\n“任何伟大的成就都是由一定数量渺小的工作积累而成的，而感谢页面中所展示的为人们提供了一种激励，使他们完成某项工作并非是因为这些工作需要完成，而是因为他们明显对组织存在价值。”\n技能只有在有些情况下才被用于区分“专业人士”和“业余爱好者”。那么“业余爱好者”的内在动机是什么？\n“业余爱好的精髓在于其内在的动机：业余爱好者做一件事是源于对它的热爱。这种动机也会影响到业余爱好者们进行团队合作的方式。”\n一项活动的高门槛，会降低参与的人数，而在大规模协调上的障碍也极大程度地将业余爱好者和专业人士区分开。\n于是，源于热爱而做某事的人们通常会默默地做事，教堂地下室、公共图书馆、车库都可能成为业余爱好者团体的家园。而专业活动可以更多地为公众所见，并且实际上很多专业团体无论在市场上还是媒体上，都将寻求公众可见度作为一个清晰的目标。\n“行为源自内在动机的人们——业余爱好者，在相对私密的环境中活动，而行为源自外在动机的人们则在更公共的场合中活动。”\n3．内在动机和公共行为\n回溯协调团体行为还很困难的年代，那时候大多数业余团体规模小，也不够正式。而如今，我们拥有一些工具，可以让团体中的人们彼此联系并分享思想和行动，于是就有了大型、公众的业余组织。\n“个人能更方便地公布他们的兴趣爱好，同时团体也可以更容易地平衡业余爱好这一动机和大量协调一致的行动。”\n协同合作的地理距离也在引人注目地向外延伸。\n如果内在动机存在于人性中最基本的部分，满足内在动机也会使我们得到满足，那么满足这些动机所使用的工具就应该被推广。\n“社会化媒体也为我们对成员资格和分享的内心渴望带来了满足。”\n社会化媒体把“发现成本”（discovery cost）降到了低点，人们能更方便地公布自己的兴趣爱好，并加入合适的团体（比如全球性的动漫迷团体、字幕组等）。社会化媒体也为我们对成员资格和分享的内心渴望带来了回报。正如尼古拉斯·米尔佐夫所说的，“网络意味着我们最终发现，人们真正感兴趣的领域是如此之广阔，广阔到疯狂的地步。”\n“在一个发现成本较低的世界里，对某些事物感兴趣的人们能够相互发现、彼此互动，远离大多数与他们没有同感的人。”\n人的内在动机十分强烈，因而更趋于可以给他们带来回报的经验。\n过去，进入公共场地非常困难，就像接受另一份工作一样，成本太大，大多数人因为嫌麻烦而不去做。\n如今，障碍被大大削弱了，我们中的任何人都可以轻而易举的找到志同道合者。\n“驾驭我们认知盈余的手段是我们获得的一种新工具，它可以使参与成为可能并给参与者带来回报。”\n但是，要想真的做成什么事，我们所有的这些原始本能还是要等待机遇来施展。\n四、“我们”为“我们”创造机会\n1．联合协作：群体创造价值\n人人都有内在动机，都希望有所作为，因为做事情既有收获又有乐趣。如今因为新工具的诞生，使得我们更加沉溺于这些动机里。\n然而，方式和动机并不足以解释我们的认知盈余在衍生出什么新用途。我们仍需要考虑机遇，即能将我们的能力实际运用到协同参与中的机会。过去，机会都被我们白白消耗掉了。认知盈余并不等于将散落在全世界的自由时间简单相加，相反，它是所有人共有的。\n“要让这些认知盈余的自由时间变得有用，就必须把所有人的时间都结合起来。同时，只有在适当的机遇来临时，这一切才能被付诸实践。”\n如果我们每个参与者都追求各自的个人目标，而缺乏分享，那么我们就不及那些在协作环境下的人们收获多，无论是思想还是成就。\n“在追求个人目标的同时深切考虑到并支持他人的追求，这种能力是人类生活的根本，实际上它太过根本，以至于我们无法将其消除。”\n20世纪下半叶的主流经济学（也称新古典经济学）通常将人的情感影响排除在金融交易活动之外，他们认为：情感要么发生在金融交易之前，要么发生在金融交易之后。\n一方面，他们认为“情感”是发生“交易”的动机，例如因为我想穿得更体面，所以买了新鞋。另一方面，他们认为“情感”是“交易”所引发的结果，例如因为我今天买了新鞋，所以很高兴。\n他们认为交易本身是冷酷无情的。然而这个被简化来的概念（理论）和许多现实情况并不一致。\n社会科学中有个非常经典的实验叫“最后的通牒游戏”（Ultimatum Game）。它是双人互动游戏，两位玩家各自有不同的角色。假设甲为提议人，乙为响应人。游戏开始后，研究者给甲10美元，并告知他有权决定如何在两人之间分配这些钱。甲提出分配方案后，乙唯一能做的就是接受或拒绝。如果接受，双方按照协议比例各自拿钱回家；如果拒绝，双方都将空手而归。\n新古典经济学认为：提议者拿走9美元，响应人也会同意的，因为聊胜于无，有好过没有。\n而现实却并非如此。如果提议者提出四六分、五五分，响应者可能接受；但如果提议者提出的过低，响应者则会拒绝，即使双方最终都拿不到。不同的游戏版本最终都证实，试验结果与新古典经济学的预测大不相同。\n“在一个社会中，人类道德标准的最大保障之一就是惩罚的意愿，即是否愿意去惩罚偏离公平准则、偏离道德规范的行为，即使这种惩罚会让自己付出一定的代价……这种个人承担成本却给社会带来利益的行为，叫做利他惩罚。人们从惩罚他人的错误中得到满足，即便这些惩罚行为会花费他们的时间、精力或者钱财。”\n网络让分享变得容易和廉价，它让全世界的人都成了潜在的参与者。\n19世纪的历史学家托克维尔（Alexis de Tocqueville）曾写道：“在民主国家，关于如何联合协作的知识，是一切知识之母。其他所有进步都有赖于这一点的进步。”这说明他已经懂得了认知盈余的优势。我们的社会生产正越来越依赖于托克维尔所说的“关于如何联合协作的知识”。\n过去，公共资源的共享及利用之所以被称为悲剧，正是因为自私的参与者会耗尽大家能取用的资源，正如牧羊人只在一块公共的草地上过度放牧，或者过度取用公共水源一样。\n今天与过去不同的是，我们可以期待在规模更大、分布更广的群体中创造出共同尊重。这些群体不在相同的地域，却能将力量汇聚一处，这些群体的创造成果不仅对参与者本身，甚至对全世界来说，都是极富价值的。\n2．社会生产：陌生人让你生活更美好\n如何让团队承担大型和复杂的任务？\n方法有很多，但对于大规模、长时间的任务来说，其机制有三层。\n●　第一层：只有在能够组织起来执行这项任务的团队，并且其所获报酬不低于市场价格的情况下，它才可能被完成（即公司，如大多数汽车就是这么被生产出来的）。\n●　第二层：在这里，即使不会得到经济上的补偿，雇员仍能胸怀责任感，共同为具有高认知价值的事情工作（即政府和非营利组织，如大多数公路都是这么修起来的）。\n●　第三层：社会生产依靠团队成员完成其对价值的创造，以及相互间的工作协调，使用的既不是价格信号也不是监管（即朋友和家庭，如大多数野餐就是这么产生的）。\n将我们的自由时间和特殊才能汇聚在一起共同创造，做有益之事的能力增强，就构成了这个年代巨大的新机遇之一。\n正如托马斯·杰弗逊（Thomas Jefferson）的名言：“点亮蜡烛照亮他人者，不会给自己带来黑暗；同样，传播思想，无损于思想的传播者。”\n今天，网络上的数字音乐之所以能够流行，也基于三个再平凡不过的原因：\n●　数字化资源无需花费任何边际成本就可以无限复制。\n●　如果分享行为足够容易，人们会非常乐意分享，在同样的情况下，我们一般不愿表现出恶意。\n●　一个程序，或者说一个音乐平台，可以很好地将前两个原因连接起来。\n“音乐分享的崛起，不是人们无视法纪造成的社会灾难，也不是一个美丽新时代到来的曙光。它只是通过正确的激励方式，将新的机遇与旧有动机结合起来的产物。只要你做到了这样的结合，你就可以从最基本的方面改变人与人之间的互动方式，从简单到如音乐分享，到复杂如公民参与这样的人类行为无一例外。”\n3．社会感染：协作的螺旋\n《纽约时报》一位记者在巴基斯坦注意到这样一则新闻：三个年轻人厌倦了国家的政治分歧和政府无法提供基本生活保障的无能，他们决定动员人们上街清扫垃圾。他们通过Facebook来召集朋友，于星期日出现在当地的一个公共市场里收集垃圾。起初，当地居民和生意人只是旁观，但随着他们的不断出现，当地人也逐渐加入进来了。\n任何群体中都会有偏离社会规范、消极行事的人，这些人在和其他社会成员享有相同机会和资源的情况下，会从事反社会行为或是发生犯罪行为。而有些人面对同样的限制和挑战，却比一般社会成员表现得更出色。这样的人，被社会学家称为“正向偏差”（positive deviance）。\n“社会感染，意在将积极的公民参与展现给自己认识的人看，这些人再展现给他们认识的人，如此一层一层传递下去。”\n“社会感染”是一个很重要的元素，没有它，这些人的正面行为就变得毫无希望。有了“社会感染”，他们的所作所为甚至可以在陌生人群中引起社会的改变。\n有研究显示，社会网络传播各种行为：如果我们周围的朋友都比较胖，那我们自己很可能也比较胖；如果我们周围的人都锻炼，那我自己很可能也在锻炼；如果我们周围的人都很快乐，我们很可能也快乐……我们甚至受到普通朋友之外的社会网络中人的影响。\n1973年，马克·格兰诺维特（Mark Granovetter）曾在一篇论文中写道：求职者倾向于通过泛泛之交而不是挚友或亲人寻找工作……\n如今，互联网成为了一个制造机会的大机器，以前所未有的省钱、省力的方式，为小团体创造新机会，同时还向史上最大规模的潜在参与者宣传这些机会。\n“社会生产并非一剂万灵药，它只是一种选择。虽然趁它有价值的时候使用它会让我们境况更好，但就像通过公司和政府制度进行的生产一样，它本身也面临着挑战。”\n即便是在最简单的共同努力或自愿参与中，各个参与者之间、参与者与团体之间，也会存在紧张关系。而其中一种帮助团队参与者增进合作能力的办法，就是共享文化的创建和维护。\n五、创造慷慨的共享文化\n1．文化是一种协调工具\n主流威慑理论是这样的：当消极后果被附加到某种行为上时，人们会减少这种行为的发生。当消极后果被移除后，之前被中断了的某种特定行为通常会再次出现。\n但是格尼茨和鲁斯蒂奇两位经济学家却重新解开了事实的真相。1998年，他们在以色列海法市的一家日托中心做了实验。\n日托中心负责白天看管因大人上班而无暇看管的孩子们，日托中心有每日指定的接孩子时间。而家长因种种情况不同，总会有家长比指定时间晚一些才能去接孩子。实验之日起，两位经济学家要求日托中心告知迟到的家长，中心设立的罚款制度：迟到10分钟以上的家长将会被罚款，罚金会被自动添加到他们的账单上。\n然而实验结果却让人惊奇：自此之后，迟到的家长反而增多了，甚至是实施罚款制度前的3倍。\n从威慑理论的角度看，这个结果有悖常理。罚金不多，但再少也应该起到一定的威慑作用。为什么没有起到威慑作用，反而不减反增呢？\n这是因为一旦设立了惩罚制度，之前模棱两可的状态便消失了，之前确立起来的行为规范也迅速瓦解了。\n“罚金将日托由共享事务变成了赤裸裸的付费交易，允许家长们将老师的时间看作商品，并且在这里还是很便宜的商品。家长会认为罚金已经代表了由他们带来的不便的全部价值，罚金同时也消除了家长对因伤害工作人员的善意而可能遇到的一些不确定后果的恐惧。”\n尽管实验过后，日托中心撤销了罚款制度，但接孩子迟到的人数并没下降到实施罚款制度前的水平。也就是说，观念一旦改变，其影响比惩罚制度更加持久。\n人们可以对迟到了的家长通过罚金的形式加以威慑，但实验结果表明，市场交易不仅仅是在人类其他动机的基础上加东西，它的存在就足以改变人类。\n将动机标价，会减少人们做事的动机。将非市场交易行为标价后，人们会减少把对方当作可以保持长期关系的人来对待的意愿。\n过去，大部分经济学家都错误地将市场交易看作是理想的甚至是默认的人类互动模型。但是有些价值，是市场创造不出来的，这些价值的创造只能靠一系列分享和相互协调性的假设，也就是靠文化。\n1645年，一群居住在伦敦的人决定拒绝相信那些没有被证实过的东西。这群人组成了一个“无形学院”（Invisible College）。“无形学院”是相对于牛津和剑桥那样的大学而言的，这群人没有固定的聚会地点，通过相互通信以及偶尔的碰面来维持团体关系。当一个成员公布自己的实验成果时，其他人不仅要知道结果是什么，还要知道实验是如何进行的，这样才能保证其结论是可靠的。科学思想家们称之为“可证伪性”。\n几十年间，“无形学院”的成员迅速发展，扩充至化学、生物学、天文学、光学等领域。“无形学院”对英国科学界的贡献非常大，以至于英国皇家学会（Royal Society）的核心都主要是由他们的成员组成的。\n他们的迅速壮大绝技是什么？\n不是工具，不是洞察力，不是远见，而是他们拥有彼此（也可以说，是文化将他们凝聚在一起）。\n“‘无形学院’的成员能更快地积累材料，将现实融入到新的实验和思考中去。通过对准确性和透明度的坚持，以及对假设与工作方法的分享，‘无形学院’的成员们能够接触到群体的集体知识并建立起一个合作圈。”\n也就是说，他们能将缓慢的个人积累和不同的信念，转化为一整套方法和成果。经过重新整合，他们让通晓某物有别于拥有某物。\n如果你有一根棍子，当别人又给了你一根，那么你就有两根棍子。但这远远不够，换个思路，当你具备将这两根棍子摩擦生火的知识，你就可以创造出前所未有的价值。增加你所拥有的物品的数量固然很好，但增加你的知识量所带来的则可能是革命性的改变。这就是为什么一个社会分享知识的方式如此重要的原因所在。\n2．共享经济学\n知识是人类所拥有的最具兼容性的东西，但是要想利用它，就需要具备一些特殊的条件，这些条件分别是：\n●　社区规模的大小\n●　共享知识的成本\n●　被共享知识的明晰性\n●　接受者们的文化规范\n“社区规模的大小”是指，一个社区里能理解某种特殊事实或方法的人越多，该社区人们合作运用这些知识的可能性就越大；“共享知识的成本”是指，任何降低传播知识成本的工具都会增加参与者；“被共享知识的明晰性”意味着，简单明了的表达，可以让观点更容易传播到其他人和其他群体中去；“接受者们的文化规范”是指，一个社区关于事物如何运行、人与人之间关系如何协调的一套共享假设。\n一位社会学家曾提出了“实践社区”（communities of practice）的概念，用来形容那些聚在一起分享知识，从而让自己得到提高的人。\n“一个实践社区，与其说是为了维护社区中某些特殊的知识，不如说是为了维护将社区团结在一起的文化。”\n这类社区中的知识时常会改变，但是对工作的文化承诺却是历久弥新的。\n新工具为我们创造新的分享型文化提供了机会，而且只有在这种条件下，分享的能力才能真正发挥出它应有的价值。\n一段开源代码的格言是这么说的：“好的社区加上糟糕的代码，等于一个好的项目。”也就是说，一个开源项目的社区成员都以“使软件不断完善”为己任，那么他们会努力去鉴别和推动进步。此外：\n“一个有很大简单调整空间的项目，会对社区有更大的吸引力，至少在社区建立初期是这样的，而一个错误百出的项目则会缺乏吸引力，让团体避之唯恐不及。”\n参与者的规范，是预测未来成功与否的关键，而这些规范在一定程度上，是基于“群体成员是如何理解彼此之间关系的”。\n3．业余参与所带来的归属感\n是什么造就了社会？\n是人类的才智和环境的不便性，共同造就了社会。社会就是由那些“它能做到”和“它不能做到”的事情不断塑造着的。\n什么是不便性？\n比如人们拼车，就是因为在更大规模层面上没有解决供求的办法。比如学习小组之所以规模小，就是因为大型、活跃的小组不能在很短的期限内一起合作。专业人士，比如大学教授、美食评论家、图书管理员等，都在为将种种“不便性”保持在人人可解决的水平上而贡献着自己的力量。\n然而今天，此前不方便的事物突然变方便了。比如，在过去，专业评论是读者能到的对餐厅唯一的公开评价；而现在你能从去过该餐厅的顾客所发表的评论中获取建议。\n今天，你的孩子也许是《星球大战》的粉丝，如果你给他两个选择：一是看一部高清的《星球大战》电影，二是在视频网上看乐高玩具版的《星球大战》片段，他一定会选择视频网，因为他想看看自己的同龄人都用这些共享知识玩出了什么新的花样，这对他才有吸引力。\n因此，是以下两股对抗力量，改变了人们对于纯粹专业化的偏见：\n●　普通人分享其所知的价值\n●　做某件事的价值在于让你拥有归属感或是慷慨感\n“有时候专业工作的价值确实胜过业余分享或归属感的价值，但在另外一些情况下，大规模长时间的分享会让人感觉更好。”\n业余工作的价值有两种：分享和归属感。\n一个平台、群体、小组，就是为大家提供了一种归属感并分享共同努力的成果。而分享是人的天性，并非是由科技催生出来的。\n六、从公用价值到公民价值\n1．个体的满足与群体的行为动机\n“分享行为”在过去被认为是受限制的，是在小环境下的行为，但如今，我们正在从这个旧理论中跳脱出来。\n“旧理论的蒙蔽使我们认为分享行为（以及大多数非市场导向的交流行为），从本质上来说就是被限制在联系密切的小规模组织内部的，而没有考虑到这种限制可能仅仅只是历史的偶然。”\n随着我们和他人沟通交流方式的改善，以及对自主参与行为所能达成的预期目标的提高，自主参与这一行为能够创造出超越我们前人的更大价值。\n“公开发表言论的成本大幅降低，聚居人群数量也随着城市化进程飞速增长，这意味着我们现在有能力将原本纷繁错杂的个人创造力集合起来，去创造具有长远价值的东西。”\n过去，各种业余组织不仅规模小，组织成本也高，共享在创造大规模长久价值方面效率低；不仅组织起来困难，其努力的成果也难以保存和得以传播。\n如今的社会生产比过去有更高的效率，其原因在于共享的广度和持久性，从过去的家庭规模提升到了全球规模。\n所有的群体内都存在情绪化的因素，正是这些“情绪”使群体得以聚集在一起而不至于分崩离析。\n“一个追求共同目标的群体必须保证自己的高效率（否则它就失去了存在的意义），同时必须保证其成员具有满足感（否则其成员就失去了留在组织内的理由）。因此，一个群体必须在其自身的效率和个体成员的满足感之间寻求平衡。”\n对于业余群体来说，个人满足感的问题更加严重，因为它对成员内在动机有更大的依赖性。但是过于关注群体的情绪化因素则有可能导致一个不良影响，即群体行动能力的削弱。\n“大多数群体面临的主要威胁实际上来自于内部，这种威胁就是陷入仅仅满足于个人情绪需求但效率低下的行为模式中。”\n也就是说，这种群体沉浸在最基本的欲望之中，群体的成员没有能力追求任何高级的目标，并且常常主动回避。\n所以，任何试图创造实际价值的群体都必须进行自我监管，以确保不会忽视自己更高的目标。\n“群体的成员努力避免自己和他人陷入个人满足但效率低下的情绪状态，如果有人确实偏离了工作轨道，他们会努力帮助其恢复到正常状态。这种成熟群体的运作机理是，成员将群体的标准内化，并遵照它来规范那些不符合标准的行为，无论是自己的行为，还是群体中其他成员的行为。”\n2．个人、群体与自由\n个人价值是我们的主动行为，是我们作为创造者而非消费者所获得的价值。比如，你拍了一张照片、编了一个篮子，你可以从中获得一些东西。这种动机，是业余爱好者们活动的驱动力。\n人类从根本上来说同时拥有“社会动机”和“个人动机”。\n“社会动机可以比单独的个人动机产生更大的参与率。”\n分享行为一般需要分享双方有较深的联系，分享一张照片表示你了解和认识你的受众，这类分享多倾向于发生在彼此认识或相熟的人之间，这是一种互惠的相互协调行为，认识的人之间的互动行为。\n如今，社会化媒体大大拓宽了分享的广度，以及它作为“分享”这个行为的生命力，使得分享的结构也具有了多种形式。例如人们现在可以在YouTube上自由分享视频，比起分享视频还很困难且受众较小的年代，现在已经有越来越多的人开始拍摄各种视频。\n个人的分享是最简单的分享形式，参与者和受益者都以个人身份参与到分享活动中，并从彼此的分享中获益。\n社会化媒体的广泛传播，使得公开发表意见变得更加便捷，这引起了“分享”这个词语意义的微妙变化。\n分享形式按照规模不同可划分为四种主要形式：\n●　个人分享（Personal Sharing），在原本没有任何联系的人们之间进行（例如某些互动网站）。\n●　公用分享（Communal Sharing），其参与性更强，在一个协作的群体之间进行（例如兴趣小组）。\n●　公共分享（Public Sharing），协作群体积极尝试创造公共资源（例如开源软件）。\n●　公民分享（Civic Sharing），表现为一个群体积极尝试改变社会（例如社会性呼吁活动）。\n以上这些贯穿个人、群体、公共领域和公民的分享形式，体现了参与者与非参与者相比所能创造的不同价值。个人分享创造的大多数价值仅使参与者本身获益；而公民分享的初衷就是为了让参与者所处的社会产生实际的变化。\n创造公用价值非常复杂，未加协调的众多贡献集合起来可以创造个人的价值，而一个互相交流合作的群体则可以创造公用的价值。\n“公共价值与公用价值一样需要广泛的交流，但要求参与者更为开放，并与新人和非参与者分享创造出来的价值。”\n公民价值在开放性上与公共价值很像，但对于致力于创造公民价值的团体来说，改良社会是他们更显著的目标。例如一些反歧视组织，其设立的目标并非只是为了自己的成员，而是改善所有类似人的状况，如果仅仅只为自己的成员创造价值，它早就不能继续发展了。\n“我们之所以应该更加关注公共价值和公民价值，不仅因为社会从中受益更多，同时也因为公共价值和公民价值更难以创造。”\n3．群体与治理\n与个人价值或公用价值不同的是，公共价值不仅要求给旧的动机以新的机会，还要求有一套阻止人们破坏群体活动进程或成果的治理机制。\n“为了成功地创造和维持公共利益，一个群体必须抵御外界的威胁，同时抵御内在的威胁。”\n外部威胁更加引人注目，因为群体很容易关注外界的敌人，但当涉及到维持一个致力于共同创造价值的自愿参与的组织时，内部威胁其实更为严重。\n由于群体活动的最大威胁来自于内部，因此自愿参与的群体需要有一定的治理机制，以保卫自己免受自身的干扰，并创造出适合自身进行创造活动的空间。\n“在个人和群体规模下的创造和活动不需要太多的治理，但是一个群体越想着手解决公共或社会的问题，群体内部干扰或分散所带来的威胁便越大，也就越需要更加严格的治理。”\n一个项目越成功，越容易引人注目，越会有更多人想要享受其创造出的价值，同时不愿做出回馈，甚至不在乎看到项目的失败。\n“我们面临的选择是：利用共享的认知盈余，我们可以创建一个无形的大学——许多‘无形学院’为创造更多公共价值和公民价值做出了巨大贡献。”\n如今，获取我们想要的东西已经非常便利，我们可以随时使用互联网找到一些有趣的东西来阅读、观看、收听。然而，要创造出真正的公共价值或公民价值，需要的不只是发表一些有趣的图片、分享一首好听的歌曲。\n“公共价值和社会价值的创造需要其核心参与团队的承诺和辛勤努力，还要求这些团体进行自我治理并致力于接受那些防止他们受到无关及娱乐元素干扰的限制措施，专注于处理复杂的任务。”\n要创建一个“无形学院”意味着要掌握一门创造群体的艺术——致力于在现有的外在市场和管理机构下独立协同工作，以便创造出全球规模的分享机会。\n但是，作为人类，我们无可救药地既想满足个人的需求，又想实现集体的效率。全心全意致力于为社会或公众服务的团体很难长久维持。\n“我们需要这样的群体创造出我们所需要的价值，而不仅是我们想要的价值。认识到应如何来创建和维护这样的群体，正是我们这个时代所面临的巨大挑战之一。”\n七、寻找鼠标，世界是“闲”的\n1．革命的悖论\n将我们的自由时间累积起来，还不足以构成认知盈余，因为我们缺少使用它的手段。将自由时间转变为认知盈余所关乎的也不仅是新的社会工具，它还需要分享、动机和开发人类真正动机的机会。\n“方式、动机和机会三者的融合，从积累的自由时间这个原材料中，生产出了认知盈余。真正的变化来自于我们认识到这种盈余所带来的前所未有的机会，或者更确切地说，它带来的前所未有的让我们为彼此创造机会的机会。”\n我们还不知道，将世界的认知盈余作为一个共享和累积的资源来看时，何种利益最终会从中凸显出来。这是尚未发生的，也是尚未解决的事。\n“鉴于创造性和慷慨行为的爆炸性增长，我们可以假设，对这个盈余的良好利用指日可待。”\n作为一个社会，我们应该用这些可能性和参与的美德做些什么呢？\n社会不像群体那样可以有对话，可以做出决定，可以开展行动。公民价值不会因为社会的突然转型而凸显出来，也不会从个体行为中冒出来，公民价值反而是从群体的工作中衍生出来的，这些群体起初很小，但随着其规模和重要性的不断增加，群体将得以不断优化。\n“以群体的形式尝试新事物，是迄今为止也是将来对社会化媒体最为意义深远的利用。”\n然而有一个“革命的悖论”需要我们面对。\n也就是说，当新工具所提供的机会越多，任何人可以从之前的社会形态推断未来的可能性也就越小。\n“在某种新工具扩散初期，就试图弄明白它的使用会如何（在哪些方面、在多大程度上）改变我们的社会，尚为时过早：巨大的变化会滞后。”\n人类发展的历史证明：我们对预测未来的行为实在是太不在行了。我们因此不必再纠结于将会用新的传播工具来做什么，因为我们的预测常不准确。\n“要从一个工具中创造出最大的价值，靠的并不是总体规划或者跨越式发展，而是连续不断的尝试与错误。对于任何一个社会来说，在这样一种转变中要面对的关键问题是，如何利用这个过程。”\n今天我们要面对的问题是，我们能利用这些机会来干些什么？这个问题的解决，更多地依赖于我们为彼此创造了什么样的机会，以及我们形成了什么样的群体文化，而不是某项特殊的技术。\n2．创建新型社会化媒体的诀窍\n关于传播工具的社会使用，有一个重要的思想线索，那就是——用户从来不会完全像系统设计者期待或希望的那样去行动。\n社会系统很复杂，即使如YouTube这样的成功，也是由用户驱动且非常偶然的，而不是由技术驱动且事先策划好的。\n创建新型社会化媒体的诀窍是什么？如何提高成功运用认知盈余的可能性？\n有三个类别：\n“创造新机会，应对早期的成长，以及根据用户不断带来的意外做出调整。”\n起步：\n●　从小事做起。那些只有在大规模下才能运行起来的工程，一般都无法发展壮大；只注重创造未来大规模成功的人，在现实中往往忽略小规模成功的重要性，而点滴的小成功才是通往大成功的必经之路。\n●　问问为什么。把自己放在使用者的角度上，还要用怀疑的眼光观察用户在参与中得到了什么。\n●　行为追随机会。行为就是被机会过滤后的动机。\n●　默认的胜利。把注意力集中在个人价值上，只会认为社会价值是可选项；把社会价值设为默认值，假设用户非常乐于为彼此创造有价值的东西，才能迅速发展壮大。\n成长：\n●　一百个用户比一打用户和一千个用户都棘手。一百人介于十几人和上千人之间，这种中间规模的团体却是最难以操作的，因为它作为单个团体来运行太大了，当作社会化自给自足的团体来说又太小；作为中型团体的一员经常会感觉很糟糕，因为既感受不到小团体的亲密感所带来的快乐，也得不到大规模团体的多样性所带来的好处。\n●　人各不同，人越多差异越大。社会系统越大，其中最活跃和最不活跃的参与者之间的区别就越大；系统越大，核心团队与边缘团队之间的差异就越大；随着系统的扩大，使得“平均用户”这个概念几乎不可能出现，也毫无意义。\n●　亲密度从不扩大。你可以和6个人举行一场亲密晚宴，但对60个人来说则不可能；每个希望大规模驾驭认知盈余的服务都会面临此消彼长的关系——大量用户、活跃的用户群、志同道合的用户群，这三者之中，你只能选择其二，几乎不可能同时拥有三者。\n●　支持型文化。要有响应者的参与，使得用户愿意亲身去执行这些规则；可见的执行规则的意愿实际上减少了管理者需要花在执行规则上的精力。\n不断调整，不断学习：\n●　学得越快，适应越快。成功运用认知盈余，从如何改变可以提供的机会方面找到答案，而不是担心怎么才能改变用户。\n●　成功比失败带来的问题更多。提前制定计划，未雨绸缪；勇于尝试，敢于迎接可能出现的困难，这比在没有遇到任何问题的情况下闭门造车更有效。\n●　明晰即暴力。在认知盈余的地盘里，命令几乎没有用；任务的关键不是要完成某事，而是要去创造一种让人们愿意去做事的环境。\n●　尝试任何事，尝试每件事。规则与设计之间的紧张关系也存在于社会化媒体中；规则是为服务保驾护航的，但是产生作用的社会服务也有一套内在逻辑，它比任何事先提供的做法都重要；认知盈余的价值取决于我们能在多大程度上允许和鼓励彼此去尝试，因为唯一能去尝试每一种可能的群体只会是每一个人。\n3．寻找鼠标\n一项新的沟通技术的出现，以及旧有制约的终止，能改变我们的结缔组织，所以重大的新机遇总是会造成对社会的重构。新机遇与旧事物的差异越大，过时的行为执意不变的可能性就越小。\n什么是一种新技术融入社会的理想方式？\n我们可以作出以下三种假设：\n●　第一种假设：我们让想要成为革命者的人通过新技术去尝试任何他们想做的事，并且不去考虑它对现有社会制度的潜在破坏。\n●　第二种假设：任何一种新技术的命运都是掌握在对当前行事方式负责的人手上的，所以我们不必去担心。\n●　第三种假设：设想改革者和传统者平等对话，改革者提议使用新技术，然后与传统者协商如何利用新事物，并保留旧事物中最好的东西。\n尽管第三种假设看上去似乎最合理，但其实第一种假设更正确，而第二种假设对社会明显是一个灾难。\n因为对现有体制的偏袒，有它的好处，至少在技术稳定时期是这样的。然而，到了革命时期，这些智力资产就变成了一种负担。\n另外，那些根深蒂固执着于旧方式的人，看不到社会是怎样从一个与传统模式不相容的方式当中获益的。\n“最重要的协商不是激进者和传统者之间的协商，而是关乎社会中的市民，在全新的可能性之下，他们是唯一能够合理决定自己想过什么样的生活的人群。”\n如今，公共媒介和私人媒介正融合在一起，专业与业余的界线也越来越模糊。\n一个四岁的小女孩在看DVD时，电影放到一半，她突然跑到电视后面去。她爸爸问：“你在做什么？”小女孩从屏幕后方探出头来说：“找鼠标。”\n如今的年轻人已经习惯了电脑时代，对于他们来说，没有鼠标的屏幕就像是缺了什么。他们也深刻地知道，那些以你为对象的媒体如果没有将你包含进去，那么就不值得在它面前待太久。\n我们就像那个四岁的小女孩一样，我们也在寻找鼠标。\n“我们四处寻找那些读者、观众、患者或者市民，他们有的被锁在创造和分享之外，有的享受着消极的或被禁锢的经验，我们发出叩问：如果能开凿出一点点认知盈余并加以利用，我们会让事情变得更好吗？我敢打赌答案是肯定的，或者换句话说，通过我们给彼此参与的机会，对彼此的尝试做出奖励的话，答案将是肯定的。”\n发布于

000亿个小时。）\n认为新媒体与传统媒体判若鸿沟的人通常也强调代际的变化。旧媒体对新媒体感到不安，很大程度上缘于上一代人对年轻人所拥有的新科技感到不安，尤其是上一代人对于已进入年轻人文化核心的新媒体感到不安。从过去媒体恐慌症的历史（如漫画、摇滚乐、电子游戏机、电视等等）来看，大人对网络内容的一切恐惧，不过是来自于对孩子自主与自行界定媒体品味需求的不安感。比如，年轻人接受游戏，而年长的人则大多拒绝它。一旦年轻人长大，年长的人逝去，游戏也会像昔日的摇滚乐成为无足争论之事。所以，反对游戏的人不仅需要面对事实，还需要面对历史。\n舍基这样的新媒体鼓吹者一般坚信，历史站在自己的一边。他观察到，在电视历史上首次出现了一部分年轻人看电视的时间少于他们父辈的现象。拥有更快捷的互动媒介的年轻一代正在把他们的行为从单纯对媒介的消费中转变过来。甚至当他们观看在线视频的时候，看似和电视没什么两样，但他们却有机会针对这些素材发表评论、分享、贴上标签、评分或者排名，当然还可以和世界上其他的观众一起讨论。这个区别实际上是参与同围观的区别：参与者会给反馈，而围观者不会。对参与社区的人们来说，电影、书籍和电视剧创造的不仅是一种消费的机会，它们创造的还是一种回应、讨论、争辩甚至创造的机会。舍基把媒介消费的这种转变称为“净认知盈余”。\n导致媒介消费量减少的选择可以是微小的，同时又是庞大的。微小的选择是一种个人行为；某人只是简单地决定下一个小时要用来创造一些事物，而不是单纯地看电视。然而数以百万计的微小选择的集合最终可能导致庞大的集体行为。全世界的认知盈余太多了，多到即使微小的变化都能累积为巨大的结果。\n而一旦改变了认知盈余的使用方法，我们将不得不重新界定“媒介”（media）这个词能代表什么。媒介在过去意味着一种商业的集合，今天，由于我们不仅消费，也创造和分享，并且我们还有能力彼此联系，所以，媒介正从一种特殊的经济部门转变为一种有组织的廉价而又全球适用的分享工具。\n舍基最爱讲的故事是一个四岁小姑娘的轶事。他在公开演讲中提过这个故事，在本书中它也出现了，甚至成为本书最后一章的标题：“寻找鼠标”，世界是‘闲’的。\n这个故事是这样的：舍基的一位朋友和他四岁的女儿一起看DVD。电影放到一半时，小姑娘毫无征兆地从沙发上跳起来跑到电视机屏幕背后去。他的这位朋友以为她想看看电影里的演员是不是真的躲在屏幕背后。但是这并不是小姑娘要找的。小姑娘围着屏幕后面的电线绕来绕去。她爸爸问：“你在做什么？”小姑娘从屏幕后方探出头来说，“找鼠标。”\n这个故事可以再一次看出舍基对年轻人使用新媒体的方式寄予的厚望：年轻人足以开始吸收身处的文化，但是对其文化的前身却知之甚少，所以完全不必受过去的媒介文化的污染。\n\n关掉电视的人干什么呢？年轻人越来越多地用电脑、手机和其他联网设备取代电视。这并非简单的硬件转移，而是用户习惯的重大迁移：人们现在可以一起做很多更有用、更好玩的事情了。\n舍基在书中列举了大量协同行动的例子，比如维基百科的编纂就是他最爱引证的证据之一，还有些例子听上去颇有些匪夷所思：在韩国民众持续抗议进口美国牛肉的事件当中，一群某个韩国男孩乐队组合的少女粉丝通过在网上的松散联系，竟然几乎迫使政府下台。\n对旧媒体、旧机构做事方式的憎厌、对新技术的拥抱以及对下一代年轻人的期许，所有这些混合起来，导致舍基倾向于讲述从电视中解放的社会革命故事的一半：在《认知盈余》，以及在更早的著作《未来是湿的》里面，舍基笔下的几乎所有网络集体行动都是积极的，每个人似乎都在使用互联网令我们这个世界变得更加美好。对于这样的论证方式，那些反技术决定论者当然也会乐于举出成打的例子，证明数字科技在生活品质的创造上，其摧毁能力大于贡献能力。\n舍基的另外一个问题是，他低估了文化消费的价值。在网络上创造愚蠢的东西的价值，果真高于阅读一本复杂的侦探小说的价值吗？是不是只要是创造就拥有了某种神圣性，而只要是消费就显示了低级智慧？美国的文化批评家史蒂文•约翰逊在他2005年出版的著作《坏事变好事》（Everything Bad Is Good for You）中，曾以游戏和电视剧为例，直接向下述说法发起挑战：大众文化是一种致人愚蠢的东西。\n例如，约翰逊争辩说，情节简单、黑白分明的电视剧早已失去市场，今天再看《豪门恩怨》，我们会十分惊异于它的天真做作。现在的电视剧叙述线索纷繁错乱，人物暧昧难明，常常含有需要观众主动填补的隐喻空间，要靠观众自行猜测人物与事件、人物与人物之间的关系。甚至连真人秀节目都在调动观众的预测性想象。在这种情况下，电视也和游戏一样，向人们提出了更高的认知能力上的要求。由此，大众文化使现代人变得聪明了，而不是相反。\n约翰逊的结论很难说是证据充足的，但同样应该指出，那些关于大众文化消费对大众的头脑充满损害性的责难，也并不完全站得住脚。舍基低估了创造性生产的质量问题——平庸是创造性生产的供应增加所必然带来的副作用。由此，我们是不是可以确定，消费一些伟大的文化产品，要胜于创造另一只“大笑猫”？\n在这里我们也可以看到舍基犯了其他媒介消费的批判者（比如说波兹曼）所易犯的同样毛病：我们不需要引用德里达的观点也可以知道，文本阅读本身就是一个创造性行为，我们必须不断地向字句的模糊性中注入意义。头脑在这里并不是简单地被浪费；我们要怀疑舍基对于创造的定义：并不是只有我们的想法结晶为物理的或者可见的剩余物才算是创造。况且，在我们真正创造出任何有意义的产物之前，我们必得经历一个消费和吸收的过程，并对我们所消费和吸收的进行思考。这也就是尼采在《查拉图斯特拉如是说》中所言，我们必须先变成啜饮一切水的骆驼，才会成为狮子。\n当然，只要舍基不把他对媒介和认知盈余的观察弄得那么两极化，这些批评其实也是无的放矢的。舍基正确地指出，人们使用媒介具有三种目的：消费、创造与分享。20世纪的媒介作为一种单一事件发展着：消费。但眼下我们正在越来越多地创造和分享媒介，这是件值得大书特书的事情。不过，消费的行为并不会全然消失，而是会继续扮演重要作用。\n全书概要\n整理/ 枫之痕\n什么是认知盈余？\n因为8小时工作制，人们每天会有8小时的自由支配时间。人类有消费（接受信息）、分享（传播信息）、创造（提供新信息）的需求。在以前人们只在电视机前进行消费，而如今，大量受过高等教育程度的人们可以通过互联网进行分享和创造。如此多的盈余时间如果能够被利用，将成为人类社会的宝贵财富。\n人们为什么喜欢看电视？\n城市人口密度暴涨以及频繁迁移，导致人们对于他人产生了不信任，所以更多的人感觉到孤独。又由于看电视是一种极其轻松的缓解孤独的手段（同时没有其他可替代产品），人们就把大量时间花费在电视上。\n看电视的危害是什么？\n仅仅接受信息，而不传播和创造，是浪费人类的智慧。玩游戏虽然低等，但至少比看电视要有意义。\n什么是媒介、媒体？\n媒介指的是传播的中间层，而非以往所认为的商业形式和素材（报纸杂志、广播电视）\n传统媒体不再是稀缺资源。媒体被重新定义为：社会的连接\n一些对于以往经验的错误认知——基本归因错误：\n人们往往会把某一代的群体定义为“懒惰、堕落”的一代。这个观点通常是错误的。他们的行为和他们的年龄关系不大，而是与社会当前的环境关系密切。\n=====美国70一代成年的时候，经济环境萧条，因此他们也变得懒惰。当经济好转以后，他们就开始奋发图强\n认知盈余的现象是什么？\n1.美国人每年2000亿小时看电视，而维基百科总花费时间只有大约1亿小时\n====编写维基百科的人的时间成本更高\n2.肯尼亚的Ushahidi平台（公共地域信息传播平台）用于政治事件跟踪、监督和救灾。这个平台可以自动收集用户上传的信息、提供事件地点信息、并且便于用户用手机发布信息。\n3.由于拥有相机的人足够多，所以任何事件都有可能被人们所发现\n4.韩国疯牛病抗议\n5.PickupPal汽车资源租赁平台\n6.葛洛班的粉丝们建立的募捐组织，0%的善款用于运营！\n7.召集人手捡垃圾——正向偏差——面对同样的限制、挑战、机会、资源，表现得更加出色的人——负责人的市民背后的驱动，是拥有共享文化、结构松散、相互协调的小组，比个人执行任务、使用价格信号的市场以及使用管理之道的政府都更有效\n8.同病相怜网站：PatientsLikeMe.com，病人们不但在情感上相互支持，还分享彼此的医疗数据（以往因为隐私条例和专有策略，而无法获得这些数据），以帮助医疗技术更好地发展。\n9.我们所面临的问题，更多是怎么样耗完这些时间\n为什么现在会存在认知盈余？认知盈余的条件是什么？\n手段（如何做）：\n1.在以前没有相应技术的环境中，人们把大量时间投入与电视中。\n2.人们不愿意记录电话号码，只是以前非这么做。现在可以把号码保存在手机上，这节约了人们的大量时间成本和精力成本。\n3.全球受教育的人口累积每年有超过一万亿的自由时间，以及公共媒介的发明和扩散。导致了人类的盈余时间成为一种共享型的全球资源，并通过设计新的参与和分享方式来利用它们。\n4.工具赋予了我们更大的可能性\n动机（为什么要做）\n人们天生喜欢互动、分享与合作（哪怕为此作出贡献、付出时间或金钱）\n一项工作，外部动机将驱逐内部动机。\n内部动机往往出自“自治”和“胜任感”，通常工作的难度处于自己能力范围的边缘时最容易产生胜任感。另外，人们也喜欢创造一些事物，这要比单纯消费更有意义。\n除了个人动机以外，人们还拥有社会动机：联系成员和分享、慷慨。而社会动机由于互联网的存在导致分享和发现同伴的成本降低而持续增加。\n人们会为了正义感而牺牲自己的利益：在最后通牒游戏中，只有当提议者和响应者的匹配关系为1VN的时候，占据优势的那一方才会分配出9：1的比例，而在其他时候，通常都接近5：5——惩罚对手的不公正行为，将会获得快感，而这足以超过因为得到少量钱而接受不公平待遇的快感（个人承当成本、却给社会带来利益——确保社会公平公正）\n该如何应用动机理论？\n1.人型纸板的提醒\n2.托儿所的罚款给人们的迟到找到了一个理由，因此迟到的行为得到了原谅，所以迟到的行为更多了。\n3.宗教，只要以捐款的形式来换取赎罪，那么罪恶就会永远存在。\n机会（时间地点、同伴）\n1.分享一本书=竞争分享，共享一个文件=拷贝分享\n认知盈余（合作）带来的社会价值是什么？\n1.在某些情况下，群体对资源的使用和管理的效率要优于市场和国家——避免了公地悲剧的出现——得益于成员之间不断的沟通和协调——参与者相互可见的行为、对共同目标的可靠承诺、成员对不轨行为的惩罚的能力——人们在社会环境中会有所节制，不那么自私\n2.化学替代了炼金术的原因是因为建立起了一套实验标准和沟通准则，将众人的力量联合起来\n3.当大众的评论纷纷出现后，美食家的评论不再像从前一样有用（虽然仍然需要美食家阐释主厨的用意、某道菜的历史渊源）——我们不需要一位在维基百科上学习的脑外科医生，但是我们并非也不需要一位业务的食评家。因为在需求方中：做手术的人很少，而吃饭的人很多。\n4.业余未必不好——我们有时与人合作或者为他人做某事的时候，虽然很业余并有可能做砸，但是效果却比请专业人士并且圆满玩完成任务更好——唱生日快乐歌或看一部同人小说——人们需要获得内在群体的归属感或慷慨感。\n5.如果某个人冒出了一个需要数十人或上千人的参与才能实现的点子，那么现在他就能以非常低的成本进行尝试，并且无须事先得到任何人的允许\n6.公民的价值不会因为社会的突然转型而凸显，而是从群体工作中衍生出来——协作圈、社区、实践的方式\n7.多达20亿的新参与者加入到媒体格局中，而这些领域之前是被一小撮专业人士所经营的。寻找绝佳点子的机会，就是让尽可能多的群体去尝试尽可能多的事物。未来并没有展现出任何上天注定的轨迹。事情之所以变得不同，是因为有人发现了如今有些事情能够成为现实，并且助力将它变成现实\n8.在各种信息泛滥的时代，人们的认知能力将大幅度提高，从而不再拥有以往单一的信仰——社会将变得更加多元\n9.从慈善全球化、教育全球化、医疗研究实践，我们集中分享的机会，远远比一本书里所举的例子要广阔的多。书中的例子只是特例。\n为什么说我们无法预测未来？\n1.印刷机刚刚问世时被用于印刷赎罪机——巩固原有阶级的统治——然而同样用于印刷马丁·路德的批判《九十五条论纲》——起到了颠覆的作用。新科技仅仅是给现存社会提供了解决正在解决的事情的快速而廉价的手段。——圣经的泛滥打破了神职人员对于圣经解释的垄断。\n2.新工具所提供的机会越多，任何人可以从之前社会形态推断未来的可能性也就越小。\n3.在某种新工具扩散初期，就试图弄明白它的使用会如何（在哪些方面、在多大程度上）改变我们的社会，尚为时过早：巨大的变化会滞后。\n4.1990年代，所有调查问人们：你如果能上网会做什么？当时最普遍的答案集中在”查信息、做功课“等。而如今，答案集中在”和家人朋友保持联系、分享照片、和兴趣相投的人聊天“。\n5.用户从来不会完全按照系统设计者期待或希望的那样去行动；观察家们总有让这些复杂的事务都就范（成为一个系统）的欲望——遗憾的事，社会系统很复杂（软件特点、社会互动、文化语境），不可能彻底理解它\n6.心智模式的不适应：在1996年，大多数人对于网络上进行社交活动还感到不自在。\n如何应对认知盈余？\n挖掘认知盈余的长处：\n1.我们要合理设计认知盈余的使用方式，让人们通过合作，充分挖掘其间的价值\n2.由产品最活跃的用户进行创新，而非产品设计者——因为贡献仍然呈现出幂律分布（长尾理论）\n3.关于如何联合协作的知识，是所有知识之母——托克维尔\n4.社群利用知识的效果：社群规模大、分享成本低、知识明晰易懂、协调与合作的文化\n5.要从一个工具中获得最大价值，靠的不仅仅是总体规划或跨越式发展，而是连续不断的尝试与错误。与任何一个社会来说，在这样一种转变中，要面对的关键问题是如果充分利用这个过程\n6.最重要的不是我们拥有新能力，而是我们如何在技术和社会的双重层面上，将这些能力转化为机会。对所有能接近新型分享模式的人而言，我们如今面对的问题，是我们能利用这些机会来做什么。这个问题的解决，更多地依赖于我们为彼此创造什么样的机会，以及我们形成什么样的群体文化，而不是某项特殊的技术\n回避认知盈余的危害：\n1.创造也不全是好事。类似大笑猫这样的创造毫无疑义，但是却十分流行。\n2.即便是在最简单的共同努力或自愿参与中，各个参与者之间，参与者与团体之间也会存在紧张关系。和社会生活的其他很多方面一样，这个问题是无解的。这个困境只能用各种妥协来化解，但是没有任何一种妥协会令人完全满意。其中一种帮助团队参与者增进合作能力的办法，就是共享文化的创建和维护。\n3.教育不能禁止交流、但也不能鼓励完全交流（答案）。在新的工具中，需要制定新的规则。确保个人与团体之间要求的平衡。\n4.建立监督和惩罚系统：\n====沙发旅行和eBay都建立了一套惩罚机制以降低风险，而遇害的旅游艺术家则误以为人心本善。\n====成本的下降创造了更大的尝试空间，尝试可以带来价值，并创造出更多盈利动机——但是也有很多想要不劳而获的人加入。\n5.对一个社会而言，充足是比稀缺更难解决的问题。\n价值的分类：\n个人分享（无特定对象的分享，暂时可能没人注意，但是未来也许会有用）\n公用分享（针对一个群体进行分享）：（大笑猫）\n公共分享（相互协作进行创造，然后面向所有可能接触到这些产品的公众）\n公民分享（相互协作进行创造，尝试改变社会，改善那些未参与者的生活）：（Ushahidi）\n群体的特征：\n群体规模：\n如果群体足够大，则不可预知的可以变得可以预知。\n一个群体该被当做个体的集合还是单一的群体来认识？——都是。\n群体行动能力减弱的特征：配对、对某物过度赞美或崇拜、过分关注外界威胁（很可能是臆想的威胁）。\n在外界威胁较大的时候，群体内部倾向于推崇比较偏执的领导人（擅长识别外在威胁），从而在群体内部形成一种令人愉悦的团结感，无论所谓的威胁是否真实存在。\n如何打造卓越的社群或团队？\n1.公开感谢所有提供帮助的人\n2.社会感染——传播正向偏差\n3.一个追求共同目标的群体必须保证自己的高效，也要保证内部成员的满足\n4.大多数群体的威胁其实来自内部——陷入仅仅满足于个人情绪需求但效率低下的行为模式中——总是回避目标。因此，必须进行自我监管。群体内化标准以后，当某群体成员偏离了这个标准，其他成员就会把该成员拉回到这个标准中——相互监督和鼓励\n5.最大化个人自由与最大化社会价值之间产生了矛盾。完全的个人自由和完全的社会控制都不是最优选择。我们需要管理并化解这个矛盾\n6.公共价值和社会价值的创造需要核心参与团队的承诺和辛勤努力，还要求团体进行自我治理并致力于接受那些防止他们受到无关及娱乐元素干扰的限制措施，专注于处理复杂的任务\n7.群体需要营造出一种奖励努力工作的员工的文化。而我们需要这样的群体创造出我们需要的价值，而不仅是我们想要的价值\n8.粉红内衣的成功来自于他们的目的并非为了所有成员，而是为了改善所有印度女性的自由。如果一个组织仅仅为自己的成员创造价值，那么早就失败了\n9.使用那些教训来掂量对你有利的机会，而不是将它们作为一套保证成功的宝典。这些教训是：创造新机会、应对早期的成长、根据用户不断带来的意外做出调整\n如何在认知盈余的时候创业？\n起步：\n从小做起：\n======如果只有少数人用，很难创造出价值——一开始需要在最合适的地点推广\n======只有在做出值得一看的成果时，团队的规模才加倍。又只有在这些人做出让其他人值得一看的成果时，团队的规模才继续加倍。\n======大规模下才能运行起来的工程一般无法发展壮大。只注意创造未来大规模成功的人，在现实中往往忽略小规模的、此时此刻的成功的重要性，而这些点滴的小成功却是通往大成就的必经之路。为了拥有一个大型而优秀的系统，最好从一个小型而优秀的系统做起，并努力使它变大变强，这样做远远好过从一个大型却平淡无奇的系统做起并努力改进。——和基因突变一样\n问问为什么：思考设计者的动机、思考使用者的动机\n以用户能够理解和关心的方式把机会提供给用户。\n提供一个能够让用户的内在动机得到回报的特别机会，最好既是个人的（自主性、竞争性），又是社会的（成员资格和慷慨心）——因为用户只会去利用那些能够被理解，并且看起来有趣又有价值的机会。\n默认的胜利：对默认值的小心使用可以塑造用户的行为——用户相互交流了一些期望（这些期望必须是用户愿意去跟随的）。Backflip（网页标签）的失败在于把用户的注意力集中于个人价值，而认为社会价值是可选项。相反，Delicious将社会价值设为默认值，假设用户会非常乐于为彼此创造有价值的东西。\n成长：\n社会制度有2种模式：充满活力和死气沉沉。对制度的最大挑战之一，就是管理成长的动机。\n100个用户比12个或1000个用户棘手。因为十几个人相互了解并拥有决定权，能够依赖小而精的团体规模来防止最恶劣的公共争端发生——小团体可以通过人情来进行管理。1000名用户的社区会被提供各种让他们满意的服务，有高度活跃的用户、完全消极的用户、推动者和批评家、争论者和调节者、以及各种各样的人，表现出承诺的连贯性——呈现出一种文化（大样本在统计学上趋于稳定）。\n===然而100人的群体作为单个团体太大，作为社会化自给自足的团体太小。\n===中型团体中的一员往往感觉很糟糕，既感受不到亲密感所带来的快乐，又得不到都市规模和多样性带来的好处\n===中型团体是文化沉淀的地方（依靠协调成员之间的行为和观点），文化一旦建立，不论它是有帮助的还是可疑的，包容的还是多疑的，都很难再改变，\n===团队成功的关键，是最初吸纳的十几名用户能够体现正确的文化规范——对于什么是正确的文化规范，不同团体间存在着差异性，像Apache这样的技术性项目，需要前期的用户具备技术技能和争论的意愿，像”负责人的市民“需要积极的离经叛道者。没有任何一种用户，也没有任何一种文化，适用于所有的情况。从100人到1000人们原先的文化都很有可能依然发挥作用。\n人各不同，人越多，差异越大。小团体里，每个人几乎可以平等地参与，而大团体里会有核心团队和边缘团队——协作圈模式。系统越大，核心与边缘团队之间的差异就越大——在互联网上，人们感兴趣的领域是如此之广，几乎到了疯狂的地步。\n将参与贡献的单位最小化，并且将贡献的门槛降到最低，维基百科通过非常广大的参与范围使它的贡献达到了最大化。\n当群体规模扩大——要么原来的参与者变成观众，要么人们各自形成了小型的、相互重叠但依然很亲密的团体——facebook让用户形成了相互重叠的社会时空你可以用户大量的用户、活跃的用户群、志同道合的用户群，但是只能3选2……\n将惩罚权力下放：当有人违反规则时，用户愿意亲自去处罚这些违反者——赋予用户这个权力——一旦发生争吵，乘务员会接管权力，并强制执行——可见的执行规则的意愿实际上降低了列车管理员的执行成本。\n没有人第一次就能把事情做对。维基百科的前身失败了，而Twitter直到智能手机普及才爆发能量。所以我们要不断从错误中吸取经验，不断学习。学习速度要很快，每半小时就更新一次。甚至安排观察者每天观察是否有用户主动使用。需要改变、创造出一种观察用户的新方式，来替代”焦点小组“和”民意调查“。\n成功也会比失败带来更多问题，因为会有敌人暗中破坏——但是计划总会漏洞百出，用户也不会按照设计者的初衷行事——虽然要提前做计划（未雨绸缪），但是限制用户的某些行为，也就限制了更多的可能性——就算对所有可想象的问题做出预防，依然要面对想象之外的问题，一般来说，用于尝新、迎接相继出现的困难，比没有遇到任何问题的情况下闭门造车更有效。文化不是靠命令产生的。任务的关键并不是要完成某件事，而是创造一种让人们愿意去做事的环境。只有出现问题以后，规则和限制才显得有价值。\n明确的规则无法在一开始就建立……\n没有任何一个人或团体，没有任何一套规则或指南可以描述出所有可能的情况。唯一最伟大的有关我们能从认知盈余里得到多少价值的预测就是：这取决于我们能在多大程度上允许和鼓励彼此去试验，因为唯一能去尝试每一种可能的群体只会是每一个人。\n新的沟通技术——重大的新机遇总是会造成对社会的重构。结缔组织随着这种连接着的社会的变化而变化、而且这种连接着的社会也随着它的结缔组织的变化而变化。\n展望未来：\n1.我们尽可能承受的混乱和无序的上限就是社会扩散所需的时间和精力。当新观念已经普及，社会性工具被接受，那么原来的混乱无序就不复存在。最重要的协商是社会中市民的协商，在全新的可能性下，他们是唯一能够合理决定自己想过什么样生活的人群。\n2.大人们已思维定势，而通过孩子们的眼睛，也许才能够看到这个世界的潜力！孩子在电视旁边找鼠标，并且认为”如果以你为对象的媒体没有把你包含进去，那么就不值得在它面前待太久“。孩子们不必删除大人们在童年获得的只消费的经验，而他们只会假设媒介同时并排包含了消费、生产、分享这几种可能性，这些可能性对每一个人都是开放的。\n3.我们四处寻找被禁锢在创造和分享之外的人，他们有的还享受着消极的或被禁锢的经验——如果我们开凿出一点点认知盈余加以利用，给予彼此参与的机会、对彼此的尝试做出奖励，那么我们一定会让世界更加美好。\n知乎周源：认知盈余时代的知识实践\n文/周源（知乎CEO）　\n　\n时间、工具和动机，恰好因某一合适的机会结合在一起时，认知盈余的巨大能量便能迅速爆发出来，每个人的参与行为本身就是一种强大的内在激励。\n　　\n《认知盈余》这本书我看的很晚，在做知乎的过程中，有用户反复问我对《认知盈余》的看法。在看这本书之前，认知盈余所释放的价值在知乎非常明显的在发生了，所以我带着一份理论结合实践的狂喜去翻这本书的。\n　　\n如何概括的把这本书的内容理清楚，我归纳为四点：时间、工具、动机和机会。\n　　1万亿小时的时间\n　　\n第一是时间。书中讲的时间资源可以总结为一句话，即全世界有一万亿小时的时间。大部分人其实有很多空闲时间，如果能把这部分闲的时间拿出来做一些有产出的事情(即那些不是为消磨时间而做，能参与社会价值交换，对他人有用的事情)，便能释放出很大的价值，比如律师业余做普法，财务业余教大家记账理财，大夫普及健康常识。\n　　\n知乎是什么情况？从上线的第一天，就反复有用户提出能不能做一个防沉迷系统，因为很多的用户在知乎上回答、提问花了比较长的时间，另外阅读的用户也花很长时间看，以至于停不下来。知乎上这些认识的或者陌生的人，在进行提问和回答时，会有一种“爽”的感觉，他们对知识有天然好奇，很关心大家都在问什么，在回答什么。这好比是一个更完整的大脑，每个人的头脑是这个更完整大脑中的某一个神经元，一旦通过某种机会连接起来，就会产生兴奋的刺激感。时间这个东西，无疑是第一个条件。\n　　随处可得的工具\n　　\n第二是工具。克莱·舍基反复提及电视是有道理的。我们认为电视是传统媒体，传统媒体的特点是很难分众。过去很长一段时间里面，我们对于电视的使用目的只是被动消费而已。有很多的行为没有在过去看电视的活动中体现出来，一个是创作，一个是分享。创作和分享要靠新工具去解决。克莱·舍基用了一个例子，比如买一台电视，电视台增加了一个消费者，但是并没有增加一个生产者。但是买一台电脑就不一样了，在增加一个消费者的同时，也增加了一个内容生产者，内容的生产者通过互联网会很容易实现广泛的连接，还会把创作和分享这两个重要的东西联系在一起。\n　　\n同样一个例子就是在知乎上，每个人不可能去掌握别人知道的知识和经验，但拥有你想知道的经验和知识的人就分散在身边，以前没有这种可能去向这些有真知灼见的人发问，对这样的人来说，知乎就是很好的工具，你可以在同一时间，对大量有专业知识的人进行提问，工具赋予了你这种可能性。\n　　\n因此，我们在知乎看到两点，一个是时间。在过去一年时间里，知乎的所有的用户在内容和生产上，一共花了200万个小时；二是，邀请人和被邀请人都非常积极，社区中形成了一个相互尊重的气氛，让提问、回答和邀请成为一个社交行为。时间和工具结合在一起，舍基一共花了四章内容在解释，而在知乎，这个事情每天都在真实的发生。\n　　更加强大的动机\n　　\n第三是动机。知乎上线第一天就有人问，“知乎上有很多的牛人，他们每天都很忙，为什么要去回答问题？”关于这个问题，知乎上有非常多的答案，我本人最喜欢的一个答案是：“我不是专家，但是我记得约翰·杜尔(风险投资基金KPCB创始人)年轻的时候说的一段话，‘我在我很年轻的时候，我拥有的知识都是我的导师教给我的，此生我无以回报，我唯一能做的事情，就是把我的所学去教授给其他人。’这个事情，这些话我虽然非常认同，但是它很感性。”\n　　\n《认知盈余》从心理学映射分析认为，每个人的动机可分两种：内部动机和外部动机。通常，问上述问题的人都会带着一个假设，谁付了他钱——这个动机是外部动机。内部动机是这个行为本身就是他的回报，按照克莱·舍基的话就是“热爱大于金钱”，这将产生很大的不同。我们过去门户级的内容创作，都是靠外部激励来成形，但在优酷和土豆上传视频的人，在豆瓣(微博)上写影评的人，大部分是没回报的。他们真正的原因是内部动机——我非常热爱这个事，我就去做了。\n　　\n有时间，工具随处可得，“有钱难买我喜欢”的动机这3个条件普遍存在，但为什么在知乎上产生了一系列有意思的用户行为？这就牵扯到第4个重要问题，机会。\n　　每个人的机会\n　　\n机会，往往是一系列偶然事件。1998年，网页的数量爆炸性增长，人们需要把网页信息组织起来的工具，谷歌(微博)、维基百科这种抓住信息与信息之间关系的产品受益于这件事，成为人人都用到的互联网产品；2003年，个人开始把越来越多信息上传到网络上，并利用网络进行交流沟通，Facebook、QQ等抓住人与人之间关系链的产品受益于这件事，成为数亿网民离不开的互联网产品。这其中有偶然性，也有网络发展的必然性。\n　　\n知乎是一个什么样的机会？人和人，信息和信息，都在网络上建立起了关系，那么在人和信息之间建立关系，是否成为接下来一系列伟大事情出现的机会呢？我们相信是的。互联网过去的历史上还没有一些专门的产品能将人和知识的关系更好地连接起来，让每个个体的动机能够有效的借助时间、工具汇聚放大成群体的力量，实现知识的创造，并且彼此享受这一成长和愉悦的过程。当一个群体在上述3大条件具备、共同完成一个任务时，你会发现这和独立个体的行为规律完全不同，它会形成一个大家互相帮助群落。知乎就产生了很多不同的群落，有些可能都是我们不知道的，但未来一定能让这些知识群落浮现出来。有点可惜的是，我们在谈论这个机会的时候，克莱·舍基并没有给出特别清晰的实例。如果他当时在知乎上与我们聊聊的话，应该会有更生动的例子。\n读点：马化腾推荐序\n文/马化腾 （腾讯董事会主席兼首席执行官）\n最近有幸读了两本克莱·舍基的书。第一本是《未来是湿的》，相信大家都知道。\n《认知盈余》是第二本。作者不愧为“互联网革命最伟大的思考者”，他对互联网给人类所带来的行为举止以及文化的变迁洞若观火。这两本著作一脉相承，它们所探讨的是这样几个问题：\n随着全球用户接触互联网的门槛变得越来越低，互联网用户数量变得更加庞大，它们将形成什么样的社会型态？我们又该如何顺应这种变化？而作为互联网的从业者们，该如何从中寻找自己的机会？\n克莱·舍基应该是一个坚定的“分享主义”倡导者。如果说，《未来是湿的》告诉我们世界正在进入一个分享的世界，人人都在享受分享所带来的“红利”，那么《认知盈余》便是在进一步阐述，我们得以分享的资源禀赋。\n任何时候，人们都不缺乏分享的欲望，为什么克莱·舍基会把它作为一个重点问题来研究？这得益于互联网所带来的技术革命，用通俗的话来说，就是“天时、地利、人和”。\n首先是天时。互联网的高速运算、处理能力，让每个从业者得以高效、快速地完成自己的工作。这意味着，每个人可以享受更多工作之外的时间；\n其次是地利。通讯成本的下降、带宽的增加，让用户接触互联网的成本变得更加低廉。网络不再是少数精英群体的专利，它像水和电一样，成了生活的必需品；\n最后是人和。接触成本的降低，不可避免地使得互联网用户呈现爆发式增长，网民和现实生活中的人群，二者的边界变得越来越模糊。正如克莱·舍基所言，“对网络的传统看法认为它是一个独立的空间，一个有别于现实世界的虚拟空间……而现在，越来越多的人使用电脑和智能手机，虚拟信息空间的整个概念都在退化。”\n网络世界越来越接近现实世界，意味着基于这个概念建立起来的互联网商业模式将要重新架构。\n我曾经说过，不管已经出现了多少大公司，人类依然处于互联网时代的黎明时分，微微的晨光还照不亮太远的路。在这个行当里，不管一家公司的赢利状况有多么喜人，也随时面临被甩出发展潮流的风险。\n发展潮流的漩涡正在席卷我们，网络正在发生演变。过去，我们可以把网络解读为一种精英享用的新兴工具，它向用户提供的是接触传统精英文化一个更加便捷的通道，也就是说互联网是内容的传递者而不是生产者；现在则不同，每个人都可以成为内容的生产者，互联网作为一个社会型态的元素，正在为社会源源不断地输出新的内容、制造新的话题。\n“认知盈余”是新时代网民赋予互联网从业者最大的红利之一。什么是“认知盈余”，克莱·舍基给出的定义很简单，就是受过教育，并拥有自由支配时间的人，他们有丰富的知识背景，同时有强烈的分享欲望。可以说，facebook、twitter以及维基百科的成功，都是“认知盈余”的功劳。在中国，微博的兴起，同样有赖于它。\n参与分享的网民数量越来越多，力量越来越强大，互联网产业也随之迎来“核聚变”，原来我们所熟知的商业模式，随时可能成为泡影。每一个从业者必须认识到，如果你不能学会主动迎接，不对这种网民自由参与分享的精神保持敬畏之心，你就会被炸得粉碎。\n一个新的互联网时代即将到来。这将是一个鼓励分享、平台崛起的时代。靠单一产品赢得用户的时代已经过去、渠道为王的传统思维不再吃香。在新的时代，如果还背着这些包袱，那就等于给波音787装了一个拖拉机的马达，想飞也飞不起来。如何铸造一个供更多合作伙伴共同创造、供用户自由选择的平台，才是互联网新时代从业者需要思考的问题。这个新时代，不再信奉传统的弱肉强食般的“丛林法则”，它更从崇尚的是“天空法则”。所谓“天高任鸟飞“，所有的人在同一天空下，但生存的维度并不完全重合，麻雀有麻雀的天空，老鹰也有老鹰的天空。决定能否成功、有多大成功的，是自己发现需求、主动创造分享平台的能力。\n在这个平台上，用户将是内容的主导者、分享的提供者。每个用户的知识贡献、内容分享，是这个平台赖以成功、赖以繁荣的重要保障，“少数人使用廉价的工具，投入很少的时间和金钱，就能在社会中开拓出足够的集体善意，创造出五年前没人能够想像的资源”。任何有意打破这种保障的行为，都将受到市场的惩罚。\n从去年年底开始，我就一直在思考，如何能将腾讯打造成一个供更多合作伙伴自由创业、供更多用户自由分享的开放平台。这是一个“摸着石头过河”的过程，它需要腾讯内外都改变心态，用更加开放的大脑去迎接变革。这段时间来，我们已经拥有了一些经验，也总结了很多教训。无论如何，我相信，这是一条正确的道路。我也相信，坚持走下去，互联网新时代的晨光就在不远的前方。\n最后想说的一点感慨是：互联网真是个神奇的东西。最近在一部科幻小说中，看到了一段对于“四维世界”的描写。仅仅在熟知的三维世界上叠加了一个维度，整个宇宙立即变得无比寥廓、无比美妙。克莱·舍基的每一次发现，其实都是在提示我们，未来人类世界的一个全新的发展维度。在互联网的推动下，整个人类社会都变成了一个妙趣无穷的实验室。我们这一代人，每个人都是这个伟大试验的设计师和参与者。这个试验，值得我们屏气凝神、心怀敬畏、全情投入。\n\n克莱·舍基《认知盈余》的核心观点是：人们的自由时间除了仅仅用于内容消费，还应更多用于内容分享和创造。分享和创造的价值远大于消费。\n自八小时工作制以及医疗水平提高让人寿命更长之后，人们业余可支配的时间越来越多。十八世纪伦敦人喜欢喝酒打发空闲时间，二十世纪后五十年的人们下班后喜欢看电视，导致人们自由时间极大浪费。科技的发展——互联网给了人们一个低成本参与全球性大项目的机会。比如Apache，Ushihidi，维基百科，Linux等等。这样的机会五百年前出现过一次，即古登堡印刷术发明之时。\n但互联网和计算机技术的出现是一个更大的飞跃。无论你兴趣多么小众，你总能在网上找到志同道合者一起讨论，比如哈利·波特忠实读者们聚集在一起创作同人小说，东方神起的粉丝们因为热衷分享新闻却走上街头（其中大多是十几岁的小姑娘）去抗议韩国政府制订的进口美国牛肉政策。\n互联网给了人们一个可能，即：汇聚微小的力量能做成大事（小事则更不用说了），比如大家熟知的维基百科以及Apache。\n互联网还提供了另一个可能，这个可能验证了经济学家、诺贝尔奖得主Elinor Ostrom在《公共事务的治理之道：集体行动制度的演进》中提出的观点：某些情况下，群体对资源的使用和管理的效果要优于市场和国家。群体中这类有效的管理通常得益于成员之间不断的沟通和协调，而这些沟通和协调往往发生在一个公共的物理空间里。互联网营造了无数个或大或小的公共空间，并且不受物理限制，同时还提供了高效及多样化的沟通渠道。\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/404/","title":"404"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/all-remote/":{"body":"All remote from\nday one: How\nGitLab thrives\nSid Sijbrandij, cofounder and CEO of\nGitLab Inc., on how the organization builds\na cohesive culture and helps its team\nmembers thrive in a fully remote workplace.\nGitLab’s roughly 2,100 team\nmembers span more than\n60 countries—and every single\none of them works remotely. Unlike many\ncompanies that were abruptly forced to\nclose their offices during the COVID-19\npandemic, GitLab has embraced a remote-\nwork environment from its inception in 2011.\nIt is now one of the largest fully remote\norganizations in the world.\nUnder cofounder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij,\nthe company has evolved from an open-\nsource collaboration tool for programmers\nto an end-to-end development, security,\nand operations (DevSecOps) platform\nwith more than 30 million registered users.\nIts rapid growth is underpinned by a set\nof norms, systems, and processes that\nenable its global workforce to collaborate\nacross time zones and schedules.\nWe spoke with Sid about how GitLab team\nmembers stay connected, sustain a healthy\nculture, and manage their time within a\nremote and asynchronous workplace.\nOne of the things that differentiates\nGitLab is that it’s fully remote. How\nhave you maintained connectivity and\nbuilt culture in this environment?\nWorking remotely is easy. The challenge\nis working asynchronously. Organizations\nmust create a system where everyone\ncan consume information and contribute\nregardless of their level, function,\nor location. We invest in working\npractices that enable asynchronous\ncommunication, and we’ve committed\nto educating and supporting other\ncompanies through the global transition\nto remote work that started during\nCOVID-19 and continues today.\nWithin GitLab, our handbook, which is\nmore than 2,700 web pages and available\nto the public, is a big part of what enables\nus to work asynchronously.1 When an\nemployee has a question, they can almost\nalways find the answer documented in our\nhandbook, without having to tap someone\non the shoulder.\nThe “handbook first” system is\nembedded in the way we work. Every\nchange must first be documented in the\nhandbook, and all communications about\nthe change include a link back to the\nhandbook. We work together to make\nsure it is always up to date. For example,\nour CMSO [chief marketing and strategy\nofficer] is responsible for maintaining the\nmarketing section, though anyone can\npropose edits as needed.\nEffective internal communication is\ncrucial in fast-paced organizations\nlike GitLab. How has that manifested\nat GitLab?\nWe rely on informal communication to\ndevelop closeness and camaraderie. Our\nonboarding process2 trains people in\nhow—and how often—we communicate\nwith each other: every new hire initiates\nfive virtual coffee chats so they learn that\nit’s normal to schedule meetings with a\ncolleague just to connect, whether it’s\nwork related or not.\nIn-person events are also a fantastic\nway to build this culture, but only if you’re\nintentional about how you use them. A\nlot of companies bring people together,\nthen lock them in a conference room to\nsit through PowerPoint presentations for\na couple of days. That’s a waste of time\nand money. They could have watched\nthose presentations asynchronously.\nAt GitLab, we spend most of our\nin-person time going on excursions,\nsharing meals, or holding an\n“un-conference,” where small groups\ndiscuss topics one after another. We\nuse our valuable time together to build\nconnections through the kind of face-to-\nface interactions that can take place only\noutside of our screens.\nWhat processes are in place to help\nemployees manage their time in a\nremote and asynchronous working\nenvironment?\nWe’re very thoughtful about how we\nuse our time. For example, meetings\nshouldn’t just be gatherings of people\nfor a conversation. Unless it’s a coffee\nchat, every meeting must have an\nagenda, and people are expected to\nread the agenda before the meeting. Our\nmeetings end at the 25- or 50-minute\nmark to give people time to prepare for\ntheir next meeting. We also try to make\nit acceptable for people to look away\nduring meetings—they manage their\nown attention and participation—and\nto interrupt politely to ask questions or\nshare context, just like you would during\nin-person conversations. We take notes\nduring every meeting and, when possible,\nrecord them so people who can’t attend\ncan still hear the conversation, and we\naim to resolve discussion with clear next\nsteps, owners, and delivery dates.\nHow does the culture at GitLab\ncontribute to its success?\nMost important, we maintain a bias\nfor action. Everyone at GitLab is\nempowered to be proactive, creative,\nand effective. We all must make\ndecisions with imperfect information;\nthis mindset helps us make the small\nones more efficiently. We document\nthem and maintain the ability to change\nthem if necessary, but there’s cultural\nsupport for everyone to do what they\nfeel is best, instead of calling meetings\nto debate every choice or action. We\nhave a higher tolerance for mistakes\nand an appreciation for which decisions\nneed discussion. Overall, this approach\nhelps us to be more effective.\nHow do you build and strengthen the\nculture over time?\nCulture isn’t preserved. It evolves.\nYou have to measure what you want to\nreinforce. At other companies, there\nis still a lot of presenteeism out there—\nwhere team members are rewarded for\njust showing up, responding quickly, and\nlooking like they are working day and\nnight. If that’s what you reward, that’s\nwhat you’re going to get. It’s much better\nto reward the results. At GitLab, we\nevaluate team members using metrics\nthat are relevant to their roles.

如01-00-00-00-00-00。\n多播组的地址是D类IP(D类IP多用于组播(多播))\n规定是224.0.0.0-239.255.255.255。\n然多播比较特殊，但是究其原理，多播的数据还是要通过数据链路层进行MAC地址绑定然后进行发送。\n※\n主机开机组播接收程序时，会向TCP/IP协议注册一个组播IP地址，所以当收到目的IP地址是这个组播组的地址时，主机就会接收。\n同时它又向工作在数据链路层的网卡也注册了一个二层MAC地址，这样的话，当主机接收到一个组播报文的时候，就可以直接现在网卡上判断是否是自己所需要的组播报文。\nIGMP：Internet组管理协议，用于主机与路由器之间交互信息的一种协议。所有要加入组播组的主机和所有连接到有组播主机的子网中的路由器都必须使用IGMP。IGMP消息不能被路由转发，只能限制在本地网段内部。IGMP的TTL参数永远是1，保证了IGMP的使用范围。\n组播路由协议的主要功能是将组播数据从一台路由器跨越一个网络传送到另外一台路由器上。\n组播的缺点\n（1）与单播协议相比没有纠错机制，发生丢包错包难以弥补，但可以通过一定的容错机制和QOS加以弥补。\n（2）现行网络虽然都支持组播的传输，但在客户认证、QOS等方面还需要完善，这些缺点在理论上都有成熟的解决方案，只是需要逐步推广应用到现存网络中。\n二层广播一般是转发用的，三层是为寻址的，二层广播是交换机mac表里面没有目的mac然后二层广播。\n三层广播用于在这个网络内向所有的节点发送数据。三层广播还有本地广播255.255.255.255和特定子网广播（定向广播），比如192.168.1.255/24之分。255.255.255.255这种本地广播是肯定没法跨越路由器的，因为一旦这种广播能跨越路由器的话，同样任何人发起的这种广播就会跑到Internet的任何角落。\n然而对于特定子网的广播（定向广播）是可以配置为允许跨路由器或者不允许跨路由器的。如果允许的话，我就可以跨越路由器对特定的子网发起三层广播，问某某地址，你的MAC地址是多少，这时明显没有对方的MAC地址就用全１了．多数情况下，对方未知都是全１,自己未知是全0．比如DHCP获取地址时，自己是没有地址的，这时发的包中源地址就是全0的。\n通常不要允许这类广播，因为你一旦允许了很容易造成ICMP Sumrf攻击的。\n广播帧的产生\n网络中存在有广播帧是不可避免的,比如开启了DHCP服务器, 每次请求, 都会有以”FF.FF.FF.FF.FF.FF”的帧格式出现．它向所有端口转发．假设主机A与B在同一个网络内,当主机A要向主机B发送信息,那么需要知道主机B的IP地址和MAC地址,这里面我们假定A只知道B的IP地址,而不知道 B的MAC地址,那么这时A就需要向网络中发送一个ARP请求,来获取B的MAC地址,这个ARP请求实际上就是一个广播包.\n二层交换原理\n二层交换设备工作在OSI模型的第二层，即数据链路层，它对数据包的转发是建立在MAC（Media Access Control ）地址基础之上的。二层交换设备不同的接口发送和接收数据独立，各接口属于不同的冲突域，因此有效地隔离了网络中物理层冲突域，使得通过它互连的主机（或网络）之间不必再担心流量大小对于数据发送冲突的影响。\n二层交换设备通过解析和学习以太网帧的源MAC来维护MAC地址与接口的对应关系（保存MAC与接口对应关系的表称为MAC表），通过其目的MAC来查找MAC表决定向哪个接口转发，基本流程如下：\n\n从上述流程可以看出，二层交换通过维护MAC表以及根据目的MAC查表转发，有效的利用了网络带宽，改善了网络性能。\n二层交换设备虽然能够隔离冲突域，但是它并不能有效的划分广播域。因为从前面介绍的二层交换设备转发流程可以看出，广播报文以及目的MAC查找失败的报文会向除报文的入接口之外的其它所有接口转发，当网络中的主机数量增多时，这种情况会消耗大量的网络带宽，并且在安全性方面也带来一系列问题。当然，通过路由器来隔离广播域是一个办法，但是由于路由器的高成本以及转发性能低的特点使得这一方法应用有限。基于这些情况，二层交换中出现了VLAN技术。\nVLAN\n路由器三层接口无法处理携带VLAN Tag的数据帧，因此交换机上联路由器的接口需配置为Access，两个路由器之间可以连trunk口。\n3. native-vlan-id 和 vlan member的区别\n答： native-vlan-id只能给接口设置一个vlan号，且这个vlan号是这个接口的默认PVID\nvlan member可以给这个接口设置多个vlan号，即vlan允许通过列表。例如，当设置native-id为10时，vlan member设置为20，40时，此时vlan列表会有10，20，40。\nVlan member是指这个接口允许通过的vlan列表，只有在此列表中的才会允许通过\nps：当一台交换机设备上有多个vlan时，其中的trunk接口允许通过的列表中有其所有端口的PVID\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/multicast/","title":"multicast"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/netsniff/":{"body":"netsniff-ng

1： RAID 1 采用镜像（mirroring）技术，数据同时写入到多个磁盘上，以提供冗余备份。在 RAID 1 中，如果一块磁盘发生故障，系统会从另一块磁盘读取数据，因此性能不会降级。\nRAID 5： RAID 5 采用条带化和分布式奇偶校验（distributed parity）技术，数据和奇偶校验信息分别存储在不同的磁盘上。在 RAID 5 中，如果一块磁盘发生故障，系统可以通过奇偶校验信息重建数据，但在此过程中性能会降级，因为需要额外的计算资源和磁盘带宽来进行数据重建。\nRAID 6： RAID 6 类似于 RAID 5，但具有两个独立的奇偶校验信息块。在 RAID 6 中，如果一块磁盘发生故障，系统也可以通过奇偶校验信息重建数据，但与 RAID 5 相比，RAID 6 具有更高的冗余度，因此性能降级可能更加轻微。\nRAID

​​​\nQ：看到产品线很多，目前FS产品是否全部都是OEM的？\nA：外观风格、工业结构、材质、颜色这些方面会做自研，会有FS统一的品牌风格和标准\nQ：客户都是偏线上，一些决策比较容易做出来的产品是线上，但是有看到有很多应用场景和解决方案，这种更加复杂的解决方案，线下主要是技术方面还是解决方案的交流呢？\nA：客户都比较专业，需求比较明确，有明确的产品和方案需求，整个跟进逻辑是销售收集需求→SR技术层面的建议和方案，主要是通过邮件沟通，如果比较复杂的话会进行线上的视频会议，但是这种情况比较少，我们比较注重效率，一般2-3小时就可以给客户发方案\nQ：SR是产品线还是区域划分的？\nA：北美区、亚太区、欧洲区划分，里面会分配SR，在每个区的10个SR会进一步去分层级划分，低层级人员是简单基础的问题，中高层级人员是按照产品线是划分的\nQ：销售三层人员，有销售助理、销售工程师、销售专家，这里是如何区分？\nA：主要是基于内部实际情况的分工去考虑，客户目前已经积累了每个人手上会有4k-1W的客户量，首先我们要把客户服务好：\n\n销售助理：客户广泛的需求，简单的订单跟进和询盘跟进，主要是客户的基础服务户\n销售工程师：重点询盘重点客户，培养关键客户和忠实的客户\n销售专家：产品线较广泛，从解决方案体系的角度让客户深入到产品体系，购买力更全\n\nQ：目前招聘的销售都是管培生，进来之后应该是销售助理对吧？\nA：FS：不强调经营销售，而是强调的是如何搭建标准的销售服务体系，销售也是分语种，英语、中文、多语言，目前这个模式也是很挑战培训体系，销售从入职之后会学习所有的产品知识，进阶学习，也会有销售案例的培训，销售技巧，我们公司可能不是很倾向销售技巧方面的培训，更加重点的是整个顶层的销售体系，让销售理解销售体系，让销售做的是无目的形的销售，不是推销产品，而是更多的跟客户建立信任感，所以从来也没有去拿销售目标去要求销售和leader；\nIBM：①销售技巧确实并不是最重要的，对于销售来说产品知识/FS产品和方案，这些都能代表公司的能力，销售需要理解和消化；②客户来使用产品和解决方案的时候，应用场景需要非常了解；③跟人打交道，不管是邮件、视频会议还是线下等方式，销售和技术都需要有与人建立信任关系的能力。这些都可以变成销售知识库，可以将这三个东西整合到一起，产品和解决方案知识难度还比较高，单独学理解会比较难，如何可以结合到应用场景以及如何跟客户达成合作，这一块做成案例培训。\n销售流程：流程本身包含了方法，关键步骤，逻辑，不需要很复杂，但是需要有，然后下面会有哪些活动和培训，主要是三个板块：\n\n公司能力：产品&amp;解决方案\n客户场景：客户行业和应用场景\n专业素养：销售和技术的专业素养，如何与人建立信任关系\n\nQ：销售流程之前有试图学习华为，但是探索之后可能不太试用与FS，FS主要是收集客户需求之后创建报价，后面才会传达FS价值观和公司能力，可能是与华为是反的，所以现在有一个疑问是是否要讲把这一块做到系统里面去，让销售做的更加顺畅？\nA：流程是根据公司能力、实际情况来定的，根据FS来的实际情况，可以把客户需求转过来，然后做好需求分析和澄清，这一点是非常重要的，初步的判断，按照目前的实际情况来设计流程即可，不用完全按照华为的LTC流程，这种是适用于销售周期很长的那种项目，但是FS的客户的成交周期会比较短，公司能力和价值的传递在客户认为价格和周期是合理的之后再做，不然没有意义；\n华为是跟爱立信学习的，所以LTC流程是这样的，当时是蛮复杂的过程，花了1年的时间，客户群体比较多，不建议在华为LTC上陷入很深，即时拿锐捷的流程来用其实也不适合，因为每个公司的定位和商业模式是不一样\n如果是要建立销售流程至少要有两套，客户类型和采购的出发点不同，诉求不同的话流程也应该不同，建议分两条流程：\n①单价相对低，相对容易，采购周期短\n②单价相对高，相对复杂，采购周期长\n在底层去统一销售思维，然后在流程上可以分两个流程，关键步骤不同，顺序也不同\nQ：现在可能并没有指导性的东西给到销售，培训销售的时候有产品知识、公司能力、销售技能、案例培训，在这个过程中并没有告诉销售从客户发起到完结是否有标准化的流程？\nA：目前是没有一个标准化的流程，缺乏培训的统一性，具体哪一个节点用什么资料和支撑物暂时没有硬性要求；建议大致的跟进客户的方式统一和一致，华为的流程建议当做故事学习一下就行。\nQ：刚才提到sales leader，leader是否会背目标，那如何考核？\nA：主要是背过程指标，对于结果上的业绩目标考核暂时没有。目前只是单一事件去做过程考核\n【FS问题交流】\n销售管理体系对外咨询2023.8\nQ：目前是有一些痛点，但是它可能只是表象问题，从根因上可能确实需要将底层逻辑统一，搭建对应的流程，然后从公司能力、关键客户、产品力等方面去突破？\nA：建议简单化，流程基于现状和未来要去的地方去建立流程，为什么要建，问题根因，解决的是根因，不是问题的表象，找到根因之后去逐步的找到解决方案，然后逐步去解决，销售人员的关键行为（活动）需要被定义出来，一堆销售活动可以分组，变成多个小组的活动，找到里面的逻辑，然后变成销售流程；Sales leader在流程落地是非常重要的，建议这些人要变成销售团队的coach，50%要放在caoch，如果leader不是一个很好的coach的话，那么销售的关键行为可能没办法落地；团队有很多人是复用的人员，看起来是专业人员，但是希望可以转变为管理人员，每个人会有不同的身份和角色\nQ：业务流程和组织方面，是可以先流程还是先组织？\nA：如果在组织层面并没有很大的影响，影响到业务上，不建议先动组织层面；业务流可以抛开组织去看业务流，有这些客户，有需求，然后到购买，增购，这个部分跟组织层面关系不大，主要是先把业务流梳理清楚之后，找到承接这部分工作的组织\nQ：描述流程和销售层面方面的痛点，客户分类分级时间管理，重点的大客户服务策略，跟踪和监控客户策略等等\nA：架构建议放在最后，阻力会比较大，建议从两个出发点去做，先优化业务流：\n①让客户更加开心，服务、人，用起来买起来更加容易\n②让销售感觉是被帮助\nQ：内部会有一些提问表单给销售使用\nA：提问表单可能比较适用于产品比较简单的，客户可能也不会按照我们提问的内容来回复，在这个里面可能会让客户感受到销售这边的不专业\nQ：除了目前的销售体系，海外还有一些资源，CSR、FR、技术支持，这些角色不完全属于销售体系，但是会一起合作针对大客户进攻和服务\nA：从工作流海外的人员和国内的销售应该是一套体系，建议是放在一起\nQ：海外的角色定位也会不清晰，拿CSR的【线上获客→客户分级→销售汇总客户情况→CSR在客户池中进行分析&amp;点评输出策略→销售执行】拿出来交流\nA：CSR可能会起到一部分sales的职责，还比较适合FS目前的现状，可能更多的是商务BD的角色\nZTP\nZTP定义：是指新出厂或空配置设备上电启动时采用的一种自动加载开局文件（包括系统软件、配置文件、补丁文件等）的功能。\nZTP作用：在部署网络设备时，设备安装完成后，需要软调工程师到安装现场，对设备进行软件调试。当设备数量较多、分布较广时，维护人员需要在每一台设备上进行手工配置，既影响了设备部署的效率，又大大增加了人力成本。设备运行ZTP开局功能，可以从文件服务器获取开局文件并自动加载，实现设备的免现场配置、部署，从而降低人力成本，并提高了设备部署的效率。\nZTP工作流程简述：交换机出厂设置DHCP自动获取IP，在AmpCon上提前设置对应站点设备的配置文件，交换机安装环境只需要提前部署好DHCP服务器（包括分配给交换机的IP以及对应文件服务器或控制器的地址信息的option字段）。前提环境准备好之后，交换机安装完成接入网络连接操作，交换机启动后会通过DHCP自动获取IP以及文件服务器或控制器的地址信息，随后自动连接文件服务器或控制器获取开局配置并重新启动运行获取到的配置。\nAPI\nAPI（Application Programming Interface，应用程序编程接口）是一组定义软件组件如何互相通信的规范。API允许不同的软件系统或组件之间进行交互，提供了一种标准的方式来访问应用程序或服务的功能。\n\n接口定义： 定义软件组件之间的接口，明确如何进行通信和交互。包括可用的功能、输入和输出参数、协议规范等。\n操作规范： 定义可以执行的操作，包括请求的格式、参数的传递方式、期望的响应等。这为开发人员提供了在应用程序或服务中执行特定功能的方法。\n协议规范： 规定了通信的协议，例如HTTP/HTTPS进行Web API通信，或使用TCP/IP进行网络通信。\n数据格式：例如JSON、XML等。\n错误处理： API规定了错误的报告和处理方式。这包括了错误代码、错误消息等信息，以帮助开发人员更好地调试和处理问题。\n总结：API提供了一种标准化的方式，使不同的软件组件能够协同工作。这种标准化带来了更好的可维护性、可扩展性和互操作性，促进了软件开发的协同和集成。\n\nAmpCon\n零接触配置，实现轻松、安全扩展\n大规模远程交换机的部署和配置管理\n支持配置和License管理，维护网络安全\n预定的备份和升级\n借助

Mr. Baldwin is skillful, one can never really know the corrosion of hate, the taste of fear or the misery of humiliation unless one has lived it. Only James Meredith knows what it really means to be James Meredith. But if the actuality cannot be known, it can be related.\n無論作者的技巧如何，鮑德溫先生的技巧如何，除非親身經歷過，否則永遠無法真正了解仇恨的腐蝕、恐懼的滋味或羞辱的痛苦。 只有詹姆斯·梅雷迪思知道成為詹姆斯·梅雷迪思真正意味著什麼。 但如果無法得知真實情況，則可以將其關聯起來。\nMr. Baldwin pleads: \"If we--and I mean the relatively conscious whites and the relatively conscious black, who must, like lovers, insist on, or create, the consciousness of others--do not falter in our duty now, we may be able, handful that we are, to end the racial nightmare, and achieve our country, and change the history of the world.\"\n鮑德溫先生懇求道：「如果我們——我指的是相對有意識的白人和相對有意識的黑人，他們必須像戀人一樣堅持或創造他人的意識——現在不要在我們的責任中動搖，我們也許我們是少數人，能夠結束種族噩夢，成就我們的國家，改變世界歷史。”\nHe wonders why God \"if His love was so great, and if He loved all His children, why were we, the blacks cast down so far?\"\nHe says, switching from visceral to intellectual inspiration, that Christianity has operated with \"unmitigated arrogance and cruelty.\" He writes of the \"remarkable arrogance that assumed that the ways and morals of others were inferior to those of the Christians. . .\"\nBut if the facts he adduces are damning, his transcendent hope remains. He says we must not ask whether it is possible for a human being to come truly moral.\n\"I think we must believe it is possible,\" he writes.\n他想知道為什麼上帝“如果他的愛如此偉大，如果他愛他所有的孩子，為什麼我們黑人如此沮喪？”\n他說，從發自內心的靈感轉向理智的靈感，基督教以「毫不掩飾的傲慢和殘忍」的方式運作。 他寫道，“認為其他人的方式和道德不如基督徒的傲慢態度......”\n但即使他列舉的事實令人震驚，他的超凡希望仍然存在。 他說我們不能問一個人是否有可能變得真正有道德。\n「我認為我們必須相信這是可能的，」他寫道。\nHe Scorns Vengeance\n\"Vengeance is not an unnatural desire of the oppressed. But Mr. Baldwin rejects it and therefore rejects Muhammad's approach. Glorification of one race and the debasement of another, he says, is a recipe for murder.\nMr. Baldwin is proud of his race, of those who have been able to \"produce children of kindergarten age who can through mobs to get to school.\" He says the \"Negro boys and girls who are facing mobs today come out of a long line improbable aristocrats--the only genuine aristocrats this country has produced.\"\n他蔑視復仇\n「復仇並不是被壓迫者的一種不自然的慾望。但鮑德溫先生拒絕復仇，因此也拒絕了穆罕默德的做法。他說，頌揚一個種族並貶低另一個種族是謀殺的根源。\n鮑德溫先生為自己的種族感到自豪，為那些能夠「培養出能夠穿過暴徒上學的幼兒園年齡的孩子」的種族感到自豪。 他說，“今天面對暴民的黑人男孩和女孩都來自一長串不可能的貴族——這個國家唯一產生的真正的貴族。”\npodman\ndocker save -o /path/to/image.tar image_name:tag\ndocker load -i /path/to/image.tar\nfor i in 20; do time docker export 8aa84bf092476bbf | ssh dev$i docker import - picos-build:debian-bullseye; done\nEmulate Docker CLI using podman.

当时我们正坐在他的隔间里，位于洛杉矶的SpaceX总部大型开放式办公室的角落处。周四，一个晴朗的下午，是Musk每周指定待在SpaceX三天中的一天，Musk笑谈说这只是开玩笑——他非常关心地球。当他不在SpaceX时，他在运作一家电动汽车公司。但这是他的风格，他在电视上看上去很严肃，日常生活中却爱开玩笑，他说一些让你惊讶的事情，伴随着咯咯的笑。\n当我到达时，Musk正在电脑前处理一连串邮件。我坐下来并环顾了一下他的办公室，一张黑色皮革沙发和一张大桌子，除了几个空酒瓶和奖状之外一无所有。从窗户望出去，是一片露天的停车场。整个工作氛围普通、实用，甚至有点单调。几分钟后，我开始担心Musk已经忘了我，但是他突然夸张的转过身，快速挪动椅子，伸出他的手说，“我是Elon。”\n这是一种友好的姿态，2014年Elon Musk不再需要自我介绍。自从乔布斯声称，有一位叫做Elon Musk的美国技术专家将占领文化想象力的高地，就有tumblr作者和subreddits人员愿意忠实的追随他。他是Robert Downey Jr’s钢铁侠的灵感来源，他的生活已经成为一个传奇。\n他在南非度过与世隔绝的童年，12岁发明了视频游戏，上个世纪 90年代中期移民去了美国。然后声名鹊起，28岁时他把创立的互联网软件公司Zip2以3亿美元的价格卖给了康柏。3年后，eBay以15亿美元的价格收购他的PayPal。最终，他认为悠闲的享乐主义不适合自己，取而代之的是一次豪赌——他将财富投入到了两个看起来非常难以实现的创业领域。他的特斯拉项目是想用电动汽车来取代世界上的现有车辆；他创办的SpaceX公司为了将火星建成殖民地。汽车制造和航空航天都是成熟的产业领域，被那些拥有着充足游说预算以及将工厂安置在所有正确的国会选区的巨无霸公司掌控着。但无论如何，Musk想同时变革这两个行业，而且他要在一代人的时间里做到这些。\n第一次互联网泡沫破灭后不久，Musk宣布了这两个计划，那时许多科技行业的百万富翁被看做仅仅是中了彩票而已。人们对此报以窃笑，把他称为粗浅的“业余爱好者”。但在2010年，他将特斯拉带上市，又一次成为了亿万富翁。SpaceX依然在非公开运营，但目前的估值肯定超过10亿美金，Musk拥有其2/3的股权。SpaceX在位于洛杉矶的工厂里从零开始制造火箭，以较为便宜的价格出售太空旅行服务，这就是为什么它的座位会早早的预定一空。公司专注在小卫星发射业务，以及太空空间站的货物运输服务，但它现在正转型到神话般的太空商业旅行。2014年9月份，NASA 选择了SpaceX和波音作为第一批可以将宇航员送入国际太空空间站的私人公司。Musk是在进行一场史诗般的竞赛，但他一直继续着他的好“运气”。每一次采访，他都会发布一些新的稀奇古怪的观点，一些看起来不可能的事情，而且还带有具体的实现日期。他一直在给你去怀疑他的新的理由。\n我去SpaceX找Musk，想聊一下他对太空探索未来的看法，看门见山，我问了一个老问题：地球已经充满了未解之谜，比如说人类自身等等，我们为什么还要花这么多钱在太空探索上？我后来意识到这个问题似乎不太公平，因为Musk是商人，又不是靠公共经费支持的太空部门。不过，他也是特例，他最大的客户是NASA，更重要的是，Musk是个想要影响人类未来的人。只要稍加提醒，他就会这么告诉你，不会因为目标的宏伟而闪烁其词，也不会去追溯过往，看有谁曾经说过这样的话。当然，Musk喜欢赚钱，他似乎很享受亿万富豪的生活，不过，他不仅仅是个资本家。无论别人怎么谈论他，Musk已经将他的财富押在了能够从根本上解决人类问题的生意上。那么，我依然很好奇，为什么要选择太空？\nMusk没有给我一个通常的答案。他没有宣称我们需要通过太空探索来激励人们；没有将太空看作是一个R&amp;D实验室来兜售太空食品和太空毯等附属科技产品；也没说太空是对人类智慧的终极考验。相反，他认为，去火星，和将数以亿计的人类从贫困中拯救出来、根除致命疾病一样，既紧迫又非常有必要。\n“我认为，有着充足的人道主义理由来实现人类生活多行星化（译者注：即能自由往返于多个行星之间）。” 他告诉我，“这是为了保护人类不被灭绝，如果有些灾难将会发生的话，那贫穷或疾病在这些灾难面前已经无关紧要，因为整个人类将要灭亡。结果可能会这样，“好消息是，贫困和疾病的问题解决了；但坏消息是，人类也灭绝了。”\nMusk一直在推动这项事业——移民火星确保人类不至灭绝——截止到目前已经十多年了，期间并非没有挫折。“很有意思，” 他说到，“并非每个人都热爱人类。看起来，有些人，或明目张胆或婉约隐晦，认为人类就是地球上的破坏者。他们会这么说，‘大自然如此美妙，在人烟稀少的偏远乡村，事情也会变得更加美好。’ 意思是，人类和文明无胜于有。但我可不吃那一套。” 他说，“我们有责任维持人类的意识之光，确保它能延续至未来。”\n自柏拉图和他的洞穴故事以来，我们一直将意识比作光，因为，像光一样，意识能够照亮一切，是它令世界显现出来。借用伟大的卡尔•萨根的表述，它是宇宙在反思自身。不过，这个比喻并不完美。人类级别的意识和光不同，光子可以贯穿于整个宇宙，而人类级别的意识在宇宙中却似乎很稀有。如同孑然一身的烛火，在一片广袤空旷的空白中独自微弱的闪烁着。\nMusk告诉我，他经常思考为什么在可观测到的宇宙空间里没有智能生物存在这个神秘的问题。当然，人类还将继续展开对地外智慧彻底的、甚至是声势浩大的搜寻。我们在这方面已经取得了巨大进步，不再只是随意地仰望下星空。50多年来，我们已经把射电望远镜对准了附近的星球，希望监测到电磁波信号——那将是一个照亮深邃太空的灯塔；我们在太阳系里进行岗哨探索；我们也在检测局域内的星球来寻找外星技术存在的证据。不久后，我们还将在遥远行星的大气层和小行星带寻找合成污染物，这可能会表明存在着外星生命的开采活动。\n这些搜寻失败的事实让人疑惑不解，人类智能不应该是独一无二的。早在哥白尼的“日心说”年代，我们就被告之，我们处于一个无差别的宇宙中，宇宙呈网状结构，由中心向外延伸达百亿光年，像无数的点点繁星镶嵌在银盘上，布满了构成物质相同的行星和卫星。如果大自然都遵循相同规则的话，那这些地方会有火山爆发后的锅状沉降，在这里有蕴藏着能量的岩石和水，最终这三者混合在一起魔法般的进化出生命，而其中肯定有些地方会孕育出第一批脆弱的细胞，直至进化出有智力的物种，这些物种聚集在一起就诞生出各种文明，这些文明会拥有远见和能力去建造太空飞船。\n“基于当前科技发展的速度，人类正在变得拥有上帝般的能力，”Musk告诉我，“你可以骑着自行车花10万年到达半人马座阿尔法星，但从变革性的层面来说这毫无意义。如果有先进文明可以存在于银河系的任何地方，存在于银河系整个138亿年历史的任意时点，那它为什么不可以随处可见？就算它行动很慢，它只需要整个宇宙寿命的万分之一就能做到无处不在，为什么不能是它？”\n地球形成五亿年后出现生物，这意味着在任何一个类地行星上都会出现微生物。但即使每个行星的表面附着着单细胞粘液，也不足以说明生命在这里无处不在。进化有着永无止境的创造力，但它似乎朝着一些特定的特征，如翅膀和眼睛，它们在生命之树上独自进化。截止到目前，科技创造的智能只能从一个细枝上萌芽。有可能人类仅仅是第一波能够从事工具制造和应用语言的物种，但也有这样一种可能——智力根本就不是自然选择偏爱的一种标准配置。我们可以认为我们自身是自然界的顶峰，是自然进化的必然终点，但可能在宇宙中像人类一样的物种实在太少以至于从来没有相遇过。或者我们可能到头来只是宇宙的局外人，孤零零地存在于那个无限延伸的宇宙中。\nMusk有着一种更为悲观的观点。“我们在宇宙中一直发现不了生命这个事实可以看做是一个理由来支持‘我们本身就是模拟状态”这个观点’，他告诉我，“就像你在玩冒险游戏，你能看到背景中的星星，但你永远也无法到达那里。如果这不算模拟，那可能我们就是存在于一个‘实验室’里，一些高等生命体正在充满好奇地观察我们如何进化，就像（我们）在皮氏培养皿中一样。Musk掷出一个个可能性，它们一个比一个令人惊讶，最后他说出了自己的中心意思：“如果你再来审视我们当前的技术水平，你会发现在我们的文明中出现了一些奇怪的事情，这里的“奇怪”是贬义。最终结果可能是，全宇宙只存在一个完整的、只属于一个行星的文明。”\n的确，只在单一星球停留的文明无法在这个宇宙中长期生存。恒星演化的科学是复杂的，但我们确信，我们伟大的星球——充盈的混合氮气将它固定并为生命提供能量——地球，在未来的某天将会无限涨大以至于表层被外大气层烧焦而变得荒凉贫瘠，甚至最终被吞噬。这一事件通常被认为将发生在距今5亿-10亿年之后，并被贴上末世论的世界末日标签。但是，我们的生态圈只有很小的几率能幸存到那时。\n5亿年后，太阳虽然不会比现在大很多，但是将会膨胀到足以灼烧整个食物链的状态。到那时，地球上所有的陆地将会融合成一个崭新的单一的大陆。随着太阳的膨胀，越来越多的辐射进入大气层，昼夜温差日益变大。超大陆（译者注：前述崭新的单一的大陆也称为超大陆，指拥有一个以上陆核continental core或克拉通的大陆）的外壳将遭受越来越多的暴力扩张与收缩。岩石将会变脆，硅酸盐将以前所未有的速度侵蚀，它们将和二氧化碳一起进入海洋深处的地壳内部。最终，因为大气层中缺乏足够的碳，树木无法进行光合作用。这颗星球将失去植物，但也会有一些植物会英勇地活下来，直至逐渐变亮的太阳将它们和依赖它们生存的地球上的动物一起杀死。\n10亿年内，海水将会全部蒸发，只留下深度超过珠穆朗玛峰高度的空空的海沟。地球将成为第二个金星，一个即使最顽强的微生物也无法生存的温室星球。这是乐观的剧情，因为它假设我们的生态圈会因为寿终正寝而自然消亡，而非是由于很多更加突然和更具冲击性的因素。毕竟，10亿年是很长的一段时间，长到可以为每种灾难的发生提供足够的概率空间，包括那些从来没有在人类记忆中出现过的灾难。\n在我们历史中出现的所有自然灾害中，洪水是最严重的，全球大洪水的故事受到冰河世纪末期冰川融化的启发。宇宙灾难在这些故事中闪烁着零星微弱的光，比如说柏拉图的蒂迈欧篇中，他讲述了Phaeton的故事，他是太阳神的儿子，却无法驾驭父亲暴烈的太阳车穿越天空，最终坠落在地球上，将地球表面烧得酥松易碎。柏拉图写到：\n\n古代智慧是伟大的，但是总的来说，人类文化是一种太新的发明以至于无法保留下我们在地质记录中发现的可怕事物。我们没有一英里宽的小行星撞击地球的故事；没有超级火山爆发；没有极度冰冻把我们的蓝色星球变成白色星球。在大规模的物种灭绝发生前，生态圈可以从这些冲击中复苏。甚至当未来地球经历那些全新的体验时，这种非凡的复原能力也不过是不起作用的自我安慰。\n十亿年的漫长时光会给我们的银河系带来另外四个轨道，而其中任意一个都可能导致我们这颗小星球和另一个星球相撞，或者卷入一场超新星爆发，又或者被伽马射线的爆炸烧成灰烬。我们可能就此成为一颗“流亡”星球，成为忧郁的游荡在宇宙中的数亿颗星球之一。我们的星球可能因为一场小概率的、不期而遇的旅程而走向终点。\n如果人类想要在这些灾难下存活下来，无论是因为“黑天鹅”现象还是因为确定性，我们需要做的就是生命体所做的那些事情：一切为了生存。我们需要开发出自己新的机能，就像我们那些曾经在水里的祖先进化出了在大气里呼吸的肺和能够支持原始运动的骨头一样，艰难的从水里走到了陆地。我们需要利用这种已经使我们这个物种踏上征程的精神来激励我们进入新大陆，这样我们近代的祖先可以慢慢的如涓涓细流般去往岛屿和群岛上，再跨越整个大洋，缓慢前行在地球灭亡的道路上。我们需要动身前往新的行星，最终前往新的星球。但我们是否需要如此急迫？\n在空间探索领域有很多大人物，比如说物理学家Freeman Dyson，他认为短期内载人航天是愚蠢的。我们人类仍然处于技术起步阶段，毕竟，距离人类第一次控制火只过去了一万年。我们已经进步得很快，从第一次篝火的火花到装置在箭筒里的炸药，再到以我们自身的力量摆脱地球引力。但并不是每一个坐着我们的火箭出发的人都能安全返回地球，在另一个星球上开辟我们的殖民地，首先需要加强航天员的安全性。也许我们现在应该停止人类航天的任务，转而通过我们的宇宙无人机探索宇宙空间，就像我们的旅行者探测器最近从太阳系边经过，给我们发回了它“看到”的星际空间图片一样。我们可以在本世纪晚一些，甚至下个世纪，在我们收获了目前科技时代的全部成果之后再恢复载人航天。我们都知道，能源、人工智能和材料科学的改革迫在眉睫，其中任何一个都可以使得载人航天变得更加简单。\n“在太空探索的圈子里，你会经常听到一个讨论，” 我对Musk说，“他们常说近期的人类太空旅行完全放错了重点……”\n“什么重点？根本就没有重点，你知道的，” 他打断我。\n“但在某种程度上，你也是在倡导其中的一个重点，” 我说，“有一种说法是，直到我们的技术足够先进之前，我们最好还是只发送探测器，你知道的，一个人呆在航天器里，会令整个工程的难度成指数倍的增加。”\n“好吧，我们发送探测器，” Musk告诉我说，“顺便提一下，它们可是非常昂贵的探测器。这些可不是那些能够讨价还价的便宜货。我们发送到火星去的最后一辆RC车可是花费了超过30亿美元。简直是机器人的地狱。用那些钱，我们可以把一群人都送上火星。”\nMusk常把一个故事挂在嘴边，SpaceX的创始神话中的一部分，就是关于他是如何熬夜一宿在NASA的网页上寻找载人火星任务的信息。这要回溯到2001年，当时太空穿梭机还在天上飞着，它们的发射持续提供着频频出现的盛况局面，足以说服那些漫不经心的旁观者们，载人航天并没有严重退步。今天，维持这种幻想已经不可能了。\n人类终有一天会去星际探险，这个想法犹如神话一样古老，但直到科学革命到时，望远镜的出现使得天空近在咫尺，这才看起来像是个切实可行的目标。1610年，天文学家约翰尼斯•开普勒在给伽利略的一封信中写道：\n“让我们共同创造适合于苍穹的船和帆，届时将会有很多人无惧于荒芜。与此同时，我们应当为这些英勇的星际遨游者准备好天体地图。”\n热气球和飞机发明之后，不少梦想家开始计划太空殖民。但直到“太空竞赛（Space Race）”，这一始于1957年世界上第一颗人造卫星——斯普特尼克，以1969年登月为结束的无与伦比的大发展时期，宇宙命运的观点才从边缘跻身主流。在随后的几十年中，它激发了整个文学界和亚文化领域的灵感，并成为了一种占主导地位的描述人类未来的通俗叙事方法。\n全世界资金最充沛的宇航局——NASA曾将人类送入太空轨道，但距今已有三年之久。现在，想要飞往国际空间站的美国人必须乘坐从哈萨克斯坦发射的俄罗斯火箭，想必弗拉基米尔•普京对此志得意满。即使那些在他们看来很成功的太空旅行也依旧是衰退的征兆，毕竟国际空间站距离地球比距离月亮要近上千倍。观看NASA航天员造访国际空间站的惊险刺激程度堪比哥伦布出征伊比沙岛。但这值得人们回味好长一段时间了。NASA的下一代火箭要到2018年才会提上议事日程，最初的迭代几乎不会好过Saturn V（译者注：土星五号，是有史以来建造的动力最强大的火箭），它出色地支持了阿波罗计划。美国总统时不时地发布一些大胆的、肯尼迪式的言论，号称要将人类送上火星，但正如Musk十多年前发现的那样，官方没有任何实质性的计划，即便是乐观主义者也表示至少也得等到2030年。\n本不该这样。就在几十年前，那时看起来我们正在进入一个探索的新纪元，这足以令文艺复兴（地理大发现）时代的海员自叹弗如。首先我们将掌控近地轨道，这样太空旅行就会安全并稀松平常；接下来我们将登上月球并在那里建立一个永久基地，作为我们飞跃到其他星球的中转站；我们接二连三地登陆其他星球，仿佛它们是池塘里的睡莲，而不是间隔几亿英里的巨大的、运动着的世界。我们的行程从登陆火星开始，然后穿过小行星带到达木星及分布在其周边的卫星；我们会沉醉于土星倾斜的光环和金色的光辉，然后向更遥远的巨型天体出发，抵达太阳系边缘的冰冷废墟。在那里太阳会看起来很小，而星星在向我们招手示意。我们将通过银河系的安全区，这里充斥着气体和火焰的环状物，它比恒星还要耀眼上几十亿倍，它们包围着银河系的猛烈的内核，接下来我们就到了星系间宇宙。我们会利用虫洞和曲率驱动，或其他难以用语言描述的物理学原理，越过横亘在我们和仙女座之间的数百万光年，而仙女座上面网络发出的光可以覆盖数千亿个星系。\n当Musk发现NASA的计划中并没有火星任务时，他以为美国人对太空探索已经失去兴趣。但是两年后公众对哥伦比亚号航天飞机灾难的反应让他改变了看法。“所有的报纸、 杂志、电视台甚至包括与太空毫无关联的媒体都在报道，”他告诉我，“是的，情况很惨，七个人死亡。但是任何时候都有七个人死亡的事件，它们并没有引起人们的注意。很明显太空已经深深的刻入美国人的心里了。”Musk认为太空竞赛是冷战时期的短暂现象，公共财力也无法持续支持这一科技霸权争夺赛。“斯普特尼克号（第一颗进入地球轨道的人造卫星）发射后，苏联就一直在叫嚷他们有比我们更好的技术，所以共产主义更好，”他告诉我，“于是我们设立了难于上青天的目标并宣称我们可以打败他们，同时也得到了资金支持。然而当意识形态战争结束之后，动力消失了，经费也很快成为了焦点。”\n1966年NASA的预算创纪录地占到美国联邦预算的4.4%，而10年后则不足1%，并且此后一直保持这一水平。经费的削减迫使NASA关闭了“土星5号”运载火箭的生产线，也停止了最后三次登月计划以及安排在八十年代末的火星任务。这就是为什么NASA网站在2001年Musk上去浏览时显得如此荒凉的原因。惊异于这个倒退，Musk认为这是意志的失败，于是开始筹划他自己的火星任务。他想要将一个装满了植物的温室送到火星，这个漫长的旅程将使这些植物成为有史以来踏上最远征程的多细胞生物。他预想，生活在那个红色星球上葱郁繁茂的生命体的图像将会令人感动，正如地球像太阳一样在月球表面升起的图像感动了过去几代人一样。再加上一点运气的话，这种情感就会被转化成增加NASA预算的政治意志。\n当Musk向美国的火箭发射公司询价时，他被告知所需成本为六千万到八千万美元。这让他难以负担，于是他尝试买一枚翻新的俄罗斯洲际弹道导弹来完成任务，但是交易商却一直抬高价格。最后他受够了，放弃了寻找更廉价的供应商，转而成立了自己的火箭公司。他的朋友们认为他疯了并且想要干涉，但是他不是那种能被说服的人。Musk强烈认为自己是一名工程师。这是他通常除了CEO之外还拥有公司CTO头衔的原因。他读了一摞又一摞关于火箭的书，想要尝试建造自己的火箭。\n六年后，一切看起来还是那么愚蠢。这是2008年，被Musk描述为他生命中最糟糕的一年。Tesla处在破产的边缘。雷曼兄弟的破产让融资变得很难。刚刚离了婚的Musk靠借钱支付生活开销。SpaceX也“熄火”了，Musk已经花费了1亿美元在公司和新火箭“猎鹰1号”上。但前三次发射，火箭都在进入轨道之前爆炸了，而第四次发射也定在了当年的早秋，如果这一次火箭也在大气层内爆炸了的话，SpaceX大概也会进入死亡名单。当时航天记者们已经在撰写它的讣告了。Musk非常需要一次短暂的休整。幸运的是，他得到了：猎鹰1号完好无损地驾着漂亮的火焰柱飞出了大气层，这被记入了史册——这是第一个到达地球轨道的私人出资建造的液体燃料火箭。\n那次成功发射让Space X跟NASA签署了一个16亿美元的合约，Musk利用这笔钱飞速扩张。自那年起，他一口气进行了15次发射，均无重大失误，其中包括首次将私人货机送往国际空间站。2013年，他签订了著名的39A发射台20年租约，这个发射台是卡纳维拉尔角神圣的伸向大海神的混凝土建筑，那里曾吸收了阿波罗号发射的火焰。今年初，他又购下了德克萨斯州布朗斯维尔附近的大片土地，计划在那里为Space X建造一座专用的太空港。“获得所有的审批许可真的耗费了很多时间，”Musk告诉我，“有不计其数的联邦机构需要去签字，最后一关则到了国家历史地标协会这里，因为内战的最后一场战役就在我们基地附近几英里处，游客们在那个旅游景点也许就能看见我们的火箭舱顶。我们也是，‘真的吗？你看见过那周围是什么样子吗？从没有人去过那里。’”\nMusk对于兜售自己快速取得成就的经历丝毫不予掩饰。事实上，他有着跟阿里一样的狂热的竞争欲望。彭博电视台的一位采访者曾经问起他一个关于特斯拉竞争者的问题，他以大笑回应。“请问你为什么笑呢？”她又问。“那你见到过他们造的车吗？” Musk回答到，表情与言语间充满质疑。如出一辙的表演倾向，也出现在在我跟Musk讨论航空航天工业时，“现在兴起了很多太空创业公司，”他告诉我，“但他们都已经失败了，或者他们的成功与时代主流毫不相关。”\n但是，Space X确实存在竞争对手，包括行业巨头以及一些充满斗志的初创公司。该公司刚刚经历了一场商业混战，耗时3年成功成为第一个将美国宇航员送入空间站的商业太空公司。尤其是在美国因为俄罗斯将坦克开进克里米亚而对其制裁的三月份，这份合同的签署变得尤为迫切。一个星期之后，俄罗斯副总理Dmitry Rogozin打趣到：“在分析了美国对我们太空工业的制裁手段之后，我建议美国应该用蹦床把他们的宇航员送去国际空间站。”\nSpace X曾经一度是拿合同的最大赢家，但它从来不是无可挑战的垄断者。舆论批评家们曾经抨击这家公司延迟发射进程，并且它在8月还经历了一次不合时宜的事故，当时该公司的一部测试火箭在刚起飞不久后就发生爆炸。最后，NASA选择在Space X与波音公司之间拆分合同，各自给了6次发射机会。Musk说他将步入以人类使命为目标的阶段，不论输赢，但是他的计划进度已经大大放缓。纵然该合同仅适用于近地轨道，但也让Musk有机会去展示他的载人航天比全世界其他任何人的都要好。这也将会给Musk他所需要的金钱与声望，以期待创造更加伟大卓越的工程壮举，一个人类跨越四十多年、一直努力尝试的伟大计划——将人类安全的送往一个全新的世界。\n大迁徙往往只是时间问题，等待海峡结冰，海洋分开，或是一个星球运行至地球附近。当这两个世界绕其轨道自行运转之时，地球与火星之间的距离波动很大。当火星运行至地球的最远端，距离大概是月亮的数千倍。但是每26个月，当运行更快速的地球运动至火星与太阳之间的位置时，它们就会排成一条直线，当这种直线运行发生在他们各自运行轨道的短轴处，火星仅需三千六百万英里就能到达，仅是月亮距离地球的150倍。下一个这样的时间窗口是在四年之后，对于发射一艘载人飞船来说太过仓促。但在2030年代中期，火星将再一次在地球上空闪烁着橙黄色的光。到那时，Musk也许就准备好了第一次开始他的一系列任务，他希望能在2040年前在火星上播下城市殖民的种子。\n“SpaceX现在只有十二岁，”他对我说，“但是到2040年，公司的寿命变成现在的三倍。如果我们在技术上以线性而不是指数性提高，那时我们就能在火星上拥有一个能够容纳成千上万人口的基地。”\nMusk告诉我第一批定居者需要自己支付所需费用。“第一批定居者不仅仅需要是自己志愿去火星，同时也需要能够承担旅途所需费用，”他说道，“这些人需要多到足以在那里建立一个可以自我维持的文明。我大致估计每人需要50万美金，而地球上将有足够的人满足这样的条件。但那不是去度假旅行，而是要像早期移民到美洲殖民地的那些人一样，需要把自己所有的钱存起来并变卖家产。”\n即使是这样的价格，销售去往火星的单程旅行也是非常困难。亲身体验太空探险，目睹地球在你身后慢慢退去，你仿佛在世界之上漂浮，在地外星球的天空之下走在一片陌生的沙漠之上，这一切都令人无限神往。但地球变成了你的天空中的一颗星星，可能有一天，你通过望远镜抬头观察地球。刚开始，它可能只是一颗蓝宝石般模糊但却澄澈的球体，然而，慢慢地，随着你的眼睛一点点适应，你也许会分辨出其中的海洋和大陆。这时，你可能会怀念上面的山川、花朵与丛林，还有那在雨林和海洋中游弋的奇妙无比的生命；你可能会在地球的黑暗一面看到一片亮点，然后意识到上面的每一个亮点都是城市，其中数百万的生命在其中交汇；你也可能会想到你的家人和好友，还有那被你抛弃在身后的数十亿的人，你可能会和其中的某个人在未来坠入爱河。\n火星上艰难的生活状况可能使你从原来的渴望慢慢变成懊悔，甚至是不安。从远处看，火星沙漠像撒哈拉或者美国西部一般闷热，但它上面的气候却比南极洲内陆更加寒冷。火星曾经被厚重的大气层包裹，但后来不知何种原因被吹散，剩余大气过于稀薄，不足以维持温压。如果你在没有太空服保护的情况下走在火星表面，你的眼和皮肤将会像燃烧的纸张一样剥落，你的血液会瞬间蒸发，而这所有的一切都将在30秒内将你杀死。即使身着太空服，你也会受到宇宙辐射和席卷整个火星的沙尘暴的侵害。因为缺少介质，你将永远不会再感受到阳光照耀和微风吹拂的感觉。实际上，刚开始你很可能只能住在没有窗户的地下洞穴里面，只不过这次天花板上没有了野马的素描。\n“即使在一百万人口之中，每人也将拥有令人惊叹的生产力，因为你们要做的是在火星上重建整个的工业基地。”\n火星终会在未来的某一天实现地球化，成为适合人类居住的天堂，只是这一天恐怕不会很快到来。尽管我们已经花了几百年时间来研究地球的自然体系，天气却依然复杂的难以预测，地质工程也依然是前沿科技。我们已经发送银色雾化的气溶胶到大气同温层，通过反射太阳光线来调节地球的温度，可是对于如何模拟整个大气层我们还是一无所知。火星之上，我们能预料的最好情况也只是由机器人建立起来的比较原始的栖息地。即使机器人可以在火星上的冰川附近或者容易开采的矿源边替我们建造一座四季酒店，但是和地球进行实现的视频会议依旧是天方夜谭，两个星球之间任何的实时信息传输都会存在严重延迟。\n幽居病可能会马上在火星上出现并流行起来，住房很小，政府很脆弱。各方面的增援和巩固可能需要七个月之久。移民社群可能会因为潜在的不足和贫瘠问题爆发内战、秩序破坏、甚至同类嗜食等社会问题。从Roanoke到Jamestown的美国移民也曾经被类似的社会体系崩溃所困扰，比起火星，他们当初的移民环境就像伊甸园一样。某些个体或许可以忍受如此恶劣的环境长达几十年甚至更长，但Musk告诉我这个计划需要100万人来形成一个可持续发展的、基因多样化的文明。\n“即使人口数高达一百万，这也是建立在每个个体都有惊人生产力的基础上，因为一个完整的工业体系需要在火星上被建立起来，”他说，“各种资源需要被开采并提炼出来，在一个自然环境远比地球更复杂的星球。那里不会有树，不会有现成的氧和氮，也没有石油。”\n我问Musk火星移民需要多久才能达到一百万人口的社群。“除去自然繁衍，如果每次可以送100人去火星，你会需要10000次才能达到100万，”他说，“但与此同时，也需要不断的货物运输来支持整个社群的生存。事实上，人均需要的消耗是非常之高的。一次的人口运输需要对应10 次的货物运输，所以货物运输会高达10万次。我们说的可是一个巨大的宇宙飞船的10万次运输。”\nMusk告诉我所有这一切都可以在一个世纪内实现。有谣言称，如此之大的宇宙飞船已在他心中初具模型——一个叫做“火星移民运输机”的概念化交通工具。当然，设计是最简单的部分，真正的挑战是如何压低成本以保证所有的输送能顺利完成。不过Musk心中早已有了答案，他说他们正在研发可以重复使用的火箭，可以实现从地球发射后再顺利返回，并于一小时后再次飞向火星。\n“火箭是地球上唯一一种可以在地球上修复并再次出发的交通工具，”他说，“你能想象每次都要建一个新的飞机吗？”制造可以重复使用的火箭的整个项目进程很慢，但其中一个模型已经成功飞了1000米，然后成功返回地球。他还告诉我们完全的可重复性可以降低两个数量级的成本，每磅重量只需几十美元。这些钱可以使地球上的发射台变成能够把宇宙飞船像子弹一样发射到太空深处比如火星的“机关枪”；这些钱也可以实现10万次输送任务。\n我们可以回头看看，试着想象一下1914年的世界，回忆过去的这一个世纪发生了多大的改变。但是，送一百万人去火星听起来像是一个科技未来主义者的幻想，这可能会让Ray Kurzweil感到羞愧。不过SpaceX的存在的确很梦幻，在和Musk对话之后，我在他那座殿堂般的工厂里闲逛，游走在一列镀铬的火箭发动机之间，它们在蓝色的霓虹灯映照下闪闪发光。\n我看到如同大一号粮仓的白色管道，技术人员在爬上爬下，从位于上方的管理人员的方形玻璃办公室俯瞰，就像排列有序的蚁穴一般。无菌室里穿着防护服的工作人员和放着EDM音乐的氛围，让人感觉仿佛是James Cameron电影中Santa工厂场景重现。想想看，在12年之前，这密如蜂巢的厂区、成列的飞船生产线并不存在，只有Musk超越一切的想象中的一些模糊概念和一些偶然迸发的念头。\n我又凭什么说SpaceX将在一个世纪内取得怎样的战绩呢？我所知道的就是Musk届时将作为一个梦想家，同时作为空间技术领域无可争议的实践派迎接欢呼。但是也会有不和谐的剧情脚本。Musk当然可以挑战飞行极限，并坐等第一次火星计划的折戟。前往火星的旅程就像冷聚变一样难以捉摸。它将是超越当前科技25年以上的伟大壮举之一。Musk可能被看作一种人文现象，一个后阿波罗时代的化身，一位Icarus（译者注：装着羽毛和蜡制成的翅膀在海上飞行的男孩，因在高空中蜡翼融化而坠海而死）。\n我问Musk，如果到了因为死亡或者其他问题迫使他交出接力棒的那一天，他的计划还一直处于想象之中，他能否平静的接受这个现实。“我希望自己能够做到，”他说，“当然要平静接受。我已经考虑很久了。我一直试着构造一个世界来使得以下情况的发生最具可能性：即当我不在的情况下，SpaceX依然能够继续它的使命。”他说。\n我朝着墙上一列相框点点头，那上面是他五个儿子的照片。“你会把接力棒交给他们吗？”他曾计划把这项事业交付给一个或者几个机构，但是现在他认为家族影响力也许更加稳固。“我只是不想让这项事业被那些利欲熏心的私募股权控制，”他说，“那将很可怕。”\n当我问Musk在未来的某一天他自己是否会去往火星时，我意识到SpaceX神圣的任务有可能会妥协让步，这种担忧重新浮出水面。“我愿意去，但如果有很高的死亡风险的话，我可能不会去，因为这会将公司置于危险境地，”他告诉我，“只有当我有充分的自信我的死亡不会导致公司的初衷被抛弃时，我才会去。” 我们可以把Musk看做是诺亚式的人物，迷恋于制造一艘极大的船（诺亚方舟），它能将人类从全球大灾难中解救出来。但他把自己看做摩西（《圣经》故事中犹太人古代领袖），他可以成功地穿越荒凉之地——就像开普勒给伽利略的信中所描绘的那样——但却从未踏入那片极乐世界。\n在我离开SpaceX前，我想知道Musk眼中人类未来的探索行为能究竟到达哪里，当一个人告诉你，在未来一个世纪以内，会有100万人居住在火星，若从可信的角度出发，你想知道他的极限。“你真的认为我们能去这些星球吗？” 我问他。\n他说：“Wow，去往另一个星系真的很难，半人马阿尔法距离我们有四光年远，如果你以十分之一光的速度前进，同时假设你的速度恒定不变——尽管这不可能，它仍将会花费你四十年的时间。如果你要待在半人马阿尔法星上并且不被压缩回到过去，你必须先加速，达到20%或者30%的光速，然后再减速。”当说到最后一点时，Musk提高声调就像小孩子玩宇宙飞船时发出来的声音一样。\n我逼迫他讲更多的关于星球的信息，但是他口风很紧，“这不仅是困难的，以现在的寿命，你需要跨代的飞船和反物质驱动力，因为这些是最高效的，同时也能实现。但是就是它非常的慢。” 我接话到：“因此你有点怀疑。”此时他有点按耐不住地说：“我不怀疑这些星球，但是我困惑当我们这么做的话，人类将会怎么样。如果我们能够建立一个火星居住地，那么我们几乎能安居于整个太阳系，因为我们将能够为太空旅行创造一个更强大的经济动力。我们将会前往木星的一些卫星，至少外围的一些如木星的卫星和其他小行星。一旦我们有这种能力而且有地球到火星的经济实力，我们将会遍布整个太阳系。但是如果我们将来有机会发射卫星或飞船到其他星系，我们必须让这些设备正常运行和工作。同时我们要聚焦于成为一个多星球文明。这些是下一步要做的。”\n你可以看到为什么NASA给Musk载人航空飞行的机会。他在制造了一个大火箭的同时也依然坚持着自己的观点。对于我们这些依旧相信宇宙天命论的人来说，他是一个复兴运动者。他能够传播和灌输自己的思想，他说如果我们呆在这里将会遭受厄运，比如火灾、风暴，甚至灭亡。同时他还说到，我们应该跟随他去探索最黑暗最危险的海岸。他向我们许诺了一个奇迹。\n本文为Aeon年度精选，由机器之心独家翻译出品，参与成员：微胖、小勺、翬、柒柒、奇、泥泥刘、电子羊、赤龙飞、熊力、酥饼、pesooa、孬孬、曾㶲、赵云峰。\nimport

布什的「類腦式」知識管理系統\n早在 1945 年，身為美國科學研究與發展辦公室主任的萬尼瓦爾·布什（ Vannevar Bush ）在 The Atlantic 雜誌上發表了一篇對後世影響深遠的著名文章「As We May Think」 。在文章中，他構想了一個用於記錄、存儲、組織和瀏覽個人知識庫的設備：Memex。\n布什把 Memex 描繪成一個書桌，其中能夠存放很多微縮膠卷，通過一套電子和機械裝置，人們可以非常方便地將文件、照片、筆記等信息存儲到微縮膠片中，並且可以很方便地索引、查看這些信息。更特別的是，人們還可以用一種線性序列重新組織這些信息，將它們形成一個信息脈絡( Associative Trail )，用來模擬人類大腦的工作模式：存儲和讀取大量的信息，並再通過某種線索將它們組織起來。\n\n布什認為 Memex 應該是一套私人文件和圖書館系統，它可以讓人們訪問巨大的易於檢索的知識片段，還可以讓人們創建個性化的信息脈絡和備註，並隨時將這些信息脈絡分享給其他人。\n他在文中有一段這樣的陳述：\n很顯然，布什認為理想型的知識管理是「類腦式」的，而 Memex 是他所構想的一個原型系統，這個原型在日後激發了個人電腦、圖形界面、以及互聯網和萬維網的誕生。\n\nNLS - 恩格爾巴特的增強人類智能係統\n到了 1960年代，也就是 Memex - 布什的「類腦式」知識管理系統 的創想被公開 15 年之後，深受布什影響的道格拉斯.恩格爾巴特（Douglas Engelbart）提出了一套人機協作系統： NLS （ oN-Line System）。在這個系統中，恩格爾巴特提出了包括 鼠標、超文本鏈接、多窗口界面等概念，這些構成了後來個人電腦的人機界面雛型。\nNLS 是1962年恩格爾巴特在其論文《 增強人類智能：一種概念性的框架 》中所設想出來的，後來他在1968年舊金山的一個計算機相關會議上進行了演示，這次演示被後人稱為：The Mother of All Demos。\n\nNLS 其實只是恩格爾巴特的增強係統理論（ Augment System ）的一個具體實現。他期望計算機能夠提升人類的智能水平，他在 1986 年的一次增強知識工作坊（ Augmented Knowledge Workshop )裡完整地介紹過這套思想。其中精彩的片段摘錄如下：\n有許多發明、技巧、方法和組織方式被集成到了工作環境之中，以增強人類的能力。把這些能力組合在一起的系統，我稱之為： 增強系統（Augmentation System）。\n我把增強系統分為兩個子系統，一個是工具系統（ Tool Systerm），它包括了所有的硬件、軟件和其他人造物； 剩下的其他部分則是人因係統（ Human System）。人因係統括了我們的自然語言，概念，形式等等。\n湧現的信息技術將會不斷地創新工具系統，使得人因係統中的大多數元素得以提升和取代，但最終的結果是能夠讓人類知識工作的能力得到巨大的提升。\n這讓我專注在文檔系統 - 因為它涉及了知識、計劃、論證等等，它對幫助我們更好地攀登知識樹至關重要，它也可以很好地體現出提升知識協作的重要性。\n我至今還沒有清晰看到人類如何能獲得新的能力，或者它們將從何而來。現在有不少讓計算機變得更快和更智能的方式，但是卻沒有讓計算機能夠增強知識工作者創造性思考和工作的方式。\n顯然，恩格爾巴特並非僅僅在創建人機交互界面，而是在創建一種增強人類智能的知識管理系統，以提升知識工作者創造知識和管理知識的效率。只是，這樣的文檔系統至今還未完全被實現。\nMemex -

Do not set GDK_BACKEND, it will break apps (e.g. Chromium and Electron).\nExperimental Wayland support in Firefox can be enabled with MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1. Firefox ESR 68 also needs the --no-remote flag because of a bug.\nLibreOffice should select Wayland by default.

It's a variable framerate\n+format, that only records new frames along with a timestamp when\n+something actually changes.\n\n\n\n+Recording in Weston is started by pressing MOD+R and stopped by\n+pressing MOD+R again.  Currently this leaves a capture.wcap file in\n+the cwd of the weston process.  The file format is documented below\n+and Weston comes with the wcap-decode tool to convert the wcap file\n+into something more usable:\n\n\n\n\nExtract single or all frames as individual png files.  This will\n\n\nproduce a lossless screenshot, which is useful if you're trying to\nscreenshot a brief glitch or something like that that's hard to\ncapture with the screenshot tool.\n\nwcap-decode takes a number of options and a wcap file as its\narguments.  Without anything else, it will show the screen size and\nnumber of frames in the file.  Pass --frame= to extract a\nsingle frame or pass --all to extract all frames as png files:\n\n[krh@minato weston]$ wcap-snapshot capture.wcap \nwcap file: size 1024x640, 176 frames\n[krh@minato weston]$ wcap-snapshot capture.wcap 20\nwrote wcap-frame-20.png\nwcap file: size 1024x640, 176 frames\n\n\n\nDecode and the wcap file and dump it as a YUV4MPEG2 stream on\n\n\nstdout.  This format is compatible with most video encoders and can\nbe piped directly into a command line encoder such as vpxenc (part\nof libvpx, encodes to a webm file) or theora_encode (part of\nlibtheora, encodes to a ogg theora file).\n\nUsing vpxenc to encode a webm file would look something like this:\n\n[krh@minato weston]$ wcap-decode  --yuv4mpeg2 ../capture.wcap |\n\n\n\nwhere we select target bitrate, pass -t 4 to let vpxenc use\nmultiple threads.  To encode to Ogg Theora a command line like this\nworks:\n\n[krh@minato weston]$ wcap-decode ../capture.wcap  --yuv4mpeg2 |\n\n\n\n\n\n+WCAP File format\n\n\n\n+The file format has a small header and then just consists of the\n+indivial frames.  The header is\n\n\nuint32_t\tmagic\nuint32_t\tformat\nuint32_t\twidth\nuint32_t\theight\n\n\n+all CPU endian 32 bit words.  The magic number is\n\n\n#define WCAP_HEADER_MAGIC\t0x57434150\n\n\n+and makes it easy to recognize a wcap file and verify that it's the\n+right endian.  There are four supported pixel formats:\n\n\n#define WCAP_FORMAT_XRGB8888\t0x34325258\n#define WCAP_FORMAT_XBGR8888\t0x34324258\n#define WCAP_FORMAT_RGBX8888\t0x34325852\n#define WCAP_FORMAT_BGRX8888\t0x34325842\n\n\n+Each frame has a header:\n\n\nuint32_t\tmsecs\nuint32_t\tnrects\n\n\n+which specifies a timestamp in ms and the number of rectangles that\n+changed since previous frame.  The timestamps are typically just a raw\n+system timestamp and the first frame doesn't start from 0ms.\n\n\n\n+A frame consists of a list of rectangles, each of which represents the\n+component-wise difference between the previous frame and the current\n+using a run-length encoding.  The initial frame is decoded against a\n+previous frame of all 0x00000000 pixels.  Each rectangle starts out\n+with\n\n\nint32_t\t\tx1\nint32_t\t\ty1\nint32_t\t\tx2\nint32_t\t\ty2\n\n\n+followed by (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1) pixels, run-length encoded.  The\n+run-length encoding uses the 'X' channel in the pixel format to encode\n+the length of the run.  That is for WCAP_FORMAT_XRGB8888, for example,\n+the length of the run is in the upper 8 bits.  For X values 0-0xdf,\n+the length is X + 1, for X above or equal to 0xe0, the run length is 1\n+&lt;&lt; (X - 0xe0 + 7).

It works with all devices that support Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), and some older devices.\nWPA2/WPA3 Transitional is a mixed mode that uses WPA3 Personal with devices that support that protocol, while allowing older devices to use WPA2 Personal (AES) instead.\nWPA2 Personal (AES) is appropriate when you can't use one of the more secure modes. In that case, also choose AES as the encryption or cipher type, if available.\nWeak security settings to avoid on your router\nDon't create or join networks that use older, deprecated security protocols. These are no longer secure, they reduce network reliability and performance, and they cause your device to show a security warning:\nWPA/WPA2 mixed modes\nWPA Personal\nWEP, including WEP Open, WEP Shared, WEP Transitional Security Network, or Dynamic WEP (WEP with 802.1X)\nTKIP, including any security setting with TKIP in the name\nSettings that turn off security, such as None, Open, or Unsecured, are also strongly discouraged. Turning off security disables authentication and encryption and allows anyone to join your network, access its shared resources (including printers, computers, and smart devices), use your internet connection, and monitor the websites you visit and other data transmitted over your network or internet connection. This is a risk even if security is turned off temporarily or for a guest network.\nNetwork name (SSID)\nSet to a single, unique name (case-sensitive) for all bands\nThe Wi-Fi network name, or SSID (service set identifier), is the name that your network uses to advertise its presence to other devices. It's also the name that nearby users see on their device's list of available networks.\nMake sure that all routers on your network use the same name for every band they support. If you give your 2.4GHz, 5GHz, or 6GHz bands different names, devices might not connect reliably to your network, to all routers on your network, or to all available bands of your routers. If your router is providing a Wi-Fi 6E network that isn't using the same name for all bands, Apple devices that support Wi-Fi 6E will identify the network as having limited compatibility.\nUse a name that's unique to your network. Don't use common names or default names such as linksys, netgear, dlink, wireless, or 2wire. Otherwise, devices that join your network are more likely to encounter other networks that have the same name, and then automatically try to connect to them.\nHidden network\nSet to Disabled\n\nAbout private Wi-Fi addresses\nTo communicate with a Wi-Fi network, a device must identify itself to the network using a unique network address called a Media Access Control (MAC) address. If the device always uses the same Wi-Fi MAC address across all networks, network operators and other network observers can more easily relate that address to the device's network activity and location over time. This allows a kind of user tracking or profiling, and it applies to all devices on all Wi-Fi networks.\nStarting with iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and watchOS 7, your device improves privacy by using a different MAC address for each Wi-Fi network. This unique MAC address is your device's private Wi-Fi address, which it uses for that network only.\nIn some cases, your device will change its private Wi-Fi address:\nIf you erase all content and settings or reset network settings on the device, your device uses a different private address the next time it connects to that network.\nStarting with iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and watchOS 8, if your device hasn’t joined the network in 6 weeks, it uses a different private address the next time it connects to that network. And if you make your device forget the network, it will also forget the private address it used with that network, unless it has been less than 2 weeks since the last time it was made to forget that network.\nJoin Wi-Fi networks with a private Wi-Fi address\nConnect to Wi-Fi networks like you normally do. A private Wi-Fi address doesn't affect how you join or use most Wi-Fi networks.\nIf a network doesn’t allow your device to join, or doesn’t allow it further network or internet access after joining, you can follow the steps bellow to stop using a private Wi-Fi address with that network.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/wireless/","title":"wireless"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/wpa/":{"body":"\n\n\n隐藏SSID可以阻止一般的WiFi搜索工具找到网络，但专业的WiFi工具或黑客仍然可以通过嗅探技术或其他手段发现隐藏的SSID。因此，它不能提供真正的安全性。\n连接到隐藏SSID的网络可能需要更多的时间，因为设备需要主动寻找并连接到网络。这可能导致一些性能问题，尤其是在移动设备上。\n网络管理员需要更多的工作来管理隐藏的SSID，因为连接新设备可能需要手动配置SSID信息。\n强大的加密和身份验证机制（如WPA3），而不是隐藏SSID，是更好的WiFi网络安全实践。隐藏SSID并不是一个真正有效的安全措施，而且可能对网络的易用性和性能产生负面影响。\n隐藏SSID提供的安全性主要是依赖于“安全通过混淆”的思想，即隐藏网络名称能够防止一般用户发现网络。然而，安全性不应该仅仅依赖于隐藏信息，因为这是一种“安全通过隐匿”的方法，而不是通过强大的加密和身份验证。\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/wpa/","title":""},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/wxphp-hello-world/":{"body":"FMS\n浅尝wxPHP\n\n\n\n先使用 `wxFormBuilder` 设计好窗体，然后其会自动生成形如 `class MainFrame extends\nwxFrame` 的代码\n\n\n将这些自动生成的代码保存成 `PHP` 源文件，然后添加一些初始化代码，最终如下：\n\n\n使用 `php wx_app_name.php` 或者 `wxphp wx_app_name.wxphp` 来执行应用\n\n\n\ndate : 2014-03-23\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/notes/wxphp-hello-world/","title":"浅尝wxPHP %template code"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/":{"body":"The posts are grouped by year.\n\nList of all tags\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/","title":"Posts"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/2020-apr/":{"body":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-1_visa#Types_of_L-1_Visas\nTypes of L-1 Visas\nThe L-1 visa has two subcategories:\nL-1A for executives and managers, valid up to 7 years.\nL-1B for workers with specialized knowledge, valid up to 5 years\nAfter the expiration of the 7 or 5 years respectively, the foreign national can generally only qualify for L-1 status again by working abroad for at least 1 year for the parent, subsidiary, affiliate or branch office of the U.S. company.\nThere are two types of L-1 procedures:\nRegular L-1 visas, which must be applied for and approved for each individual by the USCIS; and\nBlanket L-1 visas, which are available to employers that meet certain criteria.\nFor a regular L-1 visa, the company must file a petition with the USCIS and each petition is evaluated on its own merits.\nIn the case of a blanket visa L1 petition, it has already been determined by USCIS that the company qualifies for the issuance of Intracompany Transferee visa, so the individual visa applicant need only file a copy of the approved blanket petition, along with documents supporting their personal qualifications, with the U.S. consulate or embassy having jurisdiction over their place of residence proving the applicant's qualifications\nns-3 is built using C++ and Python with scripting capability.

意大利咖啡（意大利语：Espresso）是一种透过迫使接近沸腾的高压水流通过磨成细粉的咖啡制作而成的饮料。espresso一般比其他方法制作出来的咖啡更加浓厚，含有更高浓度的悬浮固体和溶解固体，如表层的咖啡脂（crema，一种奶油质地的泡沫）。因为其加压的制作过程，espresso口味强烈，其中的化学物质浓度非常高。经常用来做别的饮料的底料，如拿铁、卡布奇诺、玛琪雅朵、摩卡以及美式咖啡。\n典型的28克（1盎司）意式浓缩咖啡通常含65毫克咖啡因，而典型的滴漏咖啡通常含150－200毫克咖啡因\nEspresso咖啡是通过高热、高压水强行通过极细研磨或是稍细研磨的咖啡末制作而成。重点是细研磨的咖啡末能够保证咖啡的成分迅速被大量萃取以及被高压热水均匀穿过。这个过程通过萃取咖啡中的固体和可溶解成分，生成了一种接近糖浆质地的饮料。咖啡脂（“crema”）是通过把咖啡末中的油脂乳化为胶体产生，这在其它咖啡制作过程中不会发生。\n制作一份espresso咖啡一般被称为“pulling a shot”，这种说法来自早期杠杆操作的espresso咖啡机，因为它要求拉下弹簧活塞上的手柄，迫使热水高压通过咖啡末。今天，一般espresso咖啡机都是通过电动装置来产生压力。\n深红棕色或鹅黄色的泡沫，称之为咖啡脂(crema)\nespresso消费的崛起和城市化紧密相关，espresso咖啡店（吧）提供了社交的场所。另外，咖啡价格也由地方政府控制，因为咖啡是站立着消费的，意在推进一种“站在咖啡店”的文化。\n在英国，espresso在1950年代开始在年轻人中流行，他们觉得咖啡店比酒吧（pubs）更热情好客。\n拼法“espresso”一般被认为是正确的，而“expresso”这个拼法则较为少见。意大利使用术语 “espresso”，把拉丁词根里面的 x 都替换成了 s；x 不是意大利语标准字母表的一部分。意大利人一般就把它称作 “caffè” （咖啡），因为espresso就是最普通的咖啡；在西班牙，“café expreso” 则是正式的称呼，“café solo” （solo 意即单独，不带牛奶）则是在咖啡吧里面点饮料时的通常说法。\nEspresso的分量可以是单倍（single），双倍（double）和三倍（triple），大概对应25、50、和75毫升的标准 （normale）shot，并按比例使用研磨好的咖啡末大概为7，14，和21克；同时也要使用对应分量的过滤杯。意大利语术语 doppio 经常用来表示双倍，solo 和 tripio 则较少用来表示单倍和三倍。单倍 shot 是传统的 shot 分量，也是原来的杠杆式机器能够 pull （拉）出来的最大的尺寸，而今天双倍则是标准 shot 尺寸。\nshot 的长度（也就是强度）可以是 ristretto（缩减的），normale（标准的）或者是 lungo（长的）：这也可以是指使用同样数量的研磨咖啡和同等级别的萃取的体积较小或者较大的饮料，或者指不同长度的萃取时间。因为比例不同，咖啡脂（crema）的存在使得基于体积的比较非常困难（精确地比较需要依赖饮料的重量），但是一般都是用比例 1：1、1：2和1：3到4来指 ristretto，normale 和 lungo，对应于 30、60 和 90~120 毫升的双倍 shot。Ristretto 是这些术语里面最常用的，double 和 triple ristretto 通常和工艺咖啡联系在一起。\nRistrtto、normale、以及 lungo 也可能并不是指在不同时间结束萃取的同样的 shot——这样可能造成萃取不足（时间太短）或者萃取过度（时间太长）。取而代之的是调整咖啡研磨的精细程度（较细的用于 ristretto，较粗的用于 lungo），以便在合适的萃取结束的时候取得合适的体积。\n一个非常长的 shot 叫做 caffè crema，它比一个 lungo 还要长，体积一般在 120 ~ 240 毫升，使用较粗的咖啡末用同样的方法制作。\nespresso都先流入小杯子中，再倒入大的饮料杯中；为此可使用特殊的小咖啡杯（demitasse）或者专门的espresso咖啡壶（也可称为小发泡壶）。小壶一般有 3 液体盎司容量，足够盛放大的 lungo 以下的所有espresso，但是也有 5 盎司乃至 8 盎司的小壶。\n玛琪雅朵咖啡[注 1]（意大利语：caffè macchiato，意大利语发音：[kafˈfɛ makˈkjaːto]），也称为玛琪雅朵浓缩咖啡（意大利语：espresso macchiato），是一种使用少量牛奶或奶泡加上浓缩咖啡制作而成的咖啡饮料。玛琪雅朵（意大利语：macchiato）的意思是“标记”、“烙印”或“染色”，因此玛琪雅朵咖啡的字面意思是以牛奶来上色的浓缩咖啡。传统上，玛琪雅朵咖啡是以一杯浓缩咖啡，上面加上大约一茶匙牛奶，让牛奶浮在咖啡表面作为点缀装饰。\n焦糖玛琪雅朵（英语：Caramel Macchiato[注 1]）是一种加入焦糖的玛琪雅朵咖啡。在香浓热牛奶上加入浓缩咖啡、香草，最后淋上纯正焦糖而制成的饮品，特点是在一杯饮品里可以喝到三种不同的口味。\n摩卡咖啡（英语：Café Mocha，意大利语：Mocaccino，又名莫加或者摩卡）是意式拿铁咖啡的变种。和经典的意式拿铁咖啡一样，它通常是由三分之一的意式浓缩咖啡和三分之二的奶沫配成，不过它还会加入少量巧克力。巧克力通常会以巧克力糖浆的形式添加，但某些咖啡售卖系统便会以速溶巧克力粉取代。有时，打发了的奶油、可可粉，和棉花糖都会加在上面用来加重咖啡的香味和作为装饰之用。\n与意式卡布奇诺相同，摩卡咖啡上面也有牛奶泡沫，不过有些时候会以打发的鲜奶油取代。摩卡咖啡顶上常会加上一些肉桂粉或者可可粉。有时候也会在上面加上棉花糖增加风味或做为装饰。\n有种摩卡的变种是白摩卡咖啡（White Café Mocha），用白巧克力代替牛奶和黑巧克力。除了白摩卡咖啡之外，还有一些变种是用两种巧克力糖浆混合，它们有时被称为“斑马”（Zebras），也有时会被滑稽地叫作“燕尾服摩卡”（Tuxedo Mocha）。\n摩卡咖啡的名字起源于位在红海海边的也门小镇摩卡。这个地方在15世纪时垄断了咖啡的出口贸易，特别是对阿拉伯半岛区域的咖啡出口贸易影响特别大。\n摩卡也是一种“巧克力色”的咖啡豆（来自也门的摩卡），这让人产生了在咖啡混入巧克力的联想，并且发展出巧克力浓缩咖啡饮料。在欧洲，“摩卡咖啡”既可能指这种饮料，也可能仅仅指用摩卡咖啡豆泡出来的咖啡。\n美式咖啡（意大利语：Caffè Americano、英语：Americano）是一种咖啡做法。一般由意式浓缩咖啡加入热水制作而成。[1]或者是用意式咖啡机制作，在萃取完了浓缩咖啡后，继续让机器供水直到一杯完整的咖啡。\n一般情况下，一杯美式咖啡由两份意式浓缩咖啡加30到470毫升的热水混和而成。对西欧人而言，因为热水加入的分量很大，美式咖啡无论外观还是口感都会显得很淡。此外，咖啡的香气也会因此受到些许破坏，并不能如传统的意式咖啡般维持长久。\n黑咖啡并不等于美式咖啡，美式咖啡是一种喝法。无论是法式滤压壶或是手冲壶冲煮出的咖啡都可泛称为黑咖啡。在意大利，美式咖啡通常就是Espresso旁边放上一杯热水任你添加，浓缩咖啡与水的比例视个人口味而定，大约为1:12，美式咖啡喝.起来口味偏淡，没有意式浓缩咖啡强劲的口感，当然也更容易让不喝咖啡的人接受。\n冷知识\n美式咖啡必须用热水制。因此很难找到美式咖啡制作的冰咖啡。但是可以在做好的咖啡中加冰块成为冰咖啡。\n部分欧洲人并不喜欢香味受到破坏的美式咖啡。法国人会将美式咖啡称为“jus de chaussette”，意思是袜子汁。[注 1]\njus de chaussette的来历是指普法战争时，法军士兵在应急情况下使用袜子做为过滤的口感很差的简易咖啡。原本这个词的意思是泛指任何口感不佳的咖啡。二战后迅速变成美式咖啡的代称。\n馥芮白（英语：Flat White），又意译为平白咖啡 ，是一种流行于澳大利亚及新西兰，以意式浓缩为基底的咖啡。\n馥芮白与拿铁、卡布奇诺有些相似。区别在于馥芮白使用更少的奶泡，相对的咖啡比例较高，每一口都能喝到奶泡与底下咖啡牛奶的完美的融合，拿铁奶味更重，馥芮白咖啡味更重。\n冷泡咖啡不是冰滴咖啡，英文为Ice Drip coffee，冷泡咖啡是一种制作咖啡饮品的方式。一般所指的冷酿咖啡是由室温水浸泡放入研磨过的咖啡豆置于冰箱至少十二小时酿制而成，之后需要使用特殊滤纸或者过滤器将水与咖啡进行分离。\n而另一种冰滴式咖啡，则是利用冰块自然融化成冰水，一滴一滴滴入咖啡粉中来萃取咖啡，这个过程十分缓慢，往往要进行数小时之久，因此冰滴式咖啡的价格较为昂贵，但口感极佳。\n它发明于荷兰，又称荷兰式冰咖啡滴滤器，3-4层的玻璃容器架在木座上。\n荷兰式冰咖啡滴滤器的上层是一个装水的容器，依容量有500ml到3000ml等型式。\n虽然冰滴咖啡是荷兰发明的，但一个有趣的现象是，在荷兰几乎找不到这种咖啡，不过它反倒是在亚洲引发了冰滴风潮。在日本，冰滴咖啡已有几百年的历史，所以冰滴咖啡也被称为“Kyoto coffee”（京都咖啡）、“Japanese-style slow-drip”（日式慢滴）。而在韩国，几乎每家咖啡馆都在卖冰滴咖啡，许多有名的冰滴器具品牌也都来自日本和韩国。\n滴漏式咖啡（Drip brewing）是一种将水注入经烘焙以及研磨的咖啡豆中的冲泡咖啡的方式。水渗过研磨咖啡，吸收其焦油和香气，透过重力作用，流至过滤器的底部。冲泡过的咖啡渣被留在过滤器，而溶解的咖啡随着滴落的水珠掉进例如玻璃瓶或咖啡壶之类的中。\n拿铁玛琪雅朵\n拿铁玛琪雅朵[注 1]（意大利语：latte macchiato, 意大利语发音：[ˈlatte makˈkjaːto]） 是一种咖啡饮料，字面含义是“玷污的牛奶”。这是因为在这种饮料的制作过程中，牛奶被浓缩咖啡所“玷污”。\n又译为拿铁马（或“玛”）琪（或“奇”）（雅）朵咖啡。\n拿铁玛琪雅朵与拿铁咖啡在几方面有着显著区别：首先，拿铁玛琪雅朵是将浓缩咖啡加入到牛奶中（而不是将牛奶加入到浓缩咖啡中）；第二，拿铁玛琪雅朵有更多的奶泡，而不是简单的热牛奶；第三，多数情况下只会用半份或更少的浓缩咖啡；第四，拿铁玛琪雅朵一般是一种分层的饮料，而不像拿铁咖啡那样是混在一起的。\nmacchia”是指牛奶表面漂浮的咖啡油脂斑点，以此来明确界定这是拿铁玛琪雅朵而不是拿铁咖啡，因为在制作拿铁咖啡的过程中，传统上是先加浓缩咖啡后加牛奶，于是就不会出现“斑点”。\nLatte\n直到1980年代，拿铁咖啡一词才在意大利境外使用。一般的拿铁咖啡成分是三分之一的浓缩咖啡加三分之二的鲜奶，并打入些许奶泡。它与卡布奇诺咖啡相比，有更多奶味。\n在欧美西方文化中，称一部分人群为“喝拿铁的”（latte drinkers）已经成为常见的政治攻击。大城市中喝意式咖啡的人群，被一些人认为是精英分子行为（elitist behavior）。在美国，保守政治评论者经常称对立面为“喝拿铁的自由派菁英”（latte-drinking liberal elites）[2][3][4][5]。\n当前美国政治语境中，拿铁有特殊的含义，有专门一个词叫“拿铁自由主义者”（Latte Liberal），与英国的“香槟社会主义”、法国的“鱼子酱左派”一样是个嘲讽之词。指“一边坐在星巴克里喝咖啡一边感叹穷人困境的人”[6]。据urbandictionary在线词典网站的解释，“拿铁自由主义者”指一个在财务上安逸的人，口头上支持自由主义，但实际行为却不同。这些自由主义者坐在一起喝标价过高的星巴克咖啡并对穷人的困境表示悲伤（This term derives from liberals who sit around and drink overpriced diluted Starbucks coffee while lamenting the plight of the poor. ）[7]。\n早在1997年由保守主义作家戴维·布鲁克斯提出了“拿铁镇”（Latte town）一词，指的是采取自由主义生活方式的地区。最著名的则是2004年一则攻击参与角逐民主党总统候选人霍华德·迪安的广告，要求霍华德·迪安带着他的“支持增税、扩大政府、吃寿司、喝拿铁、开沃尔沃、读《纽约时报》、身体穿孔、热爱好莱坞的左派怪胎秀”滚回佛蒙特州老家去。\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/2020-apr/","title":"2020

In the Internet, the currently dominant address aggregation technology is a bitwise prefix matching scheme called Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). Supernetworks can also be used to help control routing table size.\nContents\nThe routing table consists of at least three information fields:\nnetwork identifier: The destination subnet and netmask\nmetric: The routing metric of the path through which the packet is to be sent. The route will go in the direction of the gateway with the lowest metric.\nnext hop: The next hop, or gateway, is the address of the next station to which the packet is to be sent on the way to its final destination\nDepending on the application and implementation, it can also contain additional values that refine path selection:\nquality of service associated with the route. For example, the U flag indicates that an IP route is up.\nfiltering criteria: Access-control lists associated with the route\ninterface: Such as eth0 for the first Ethernet card, eth1 for the second Ethernet card, etc.\nShown below is an example of what the table above could look like on a computer connected to the internet via a home router:\nExample routing table contents\nNetwork destination\tNetmask\tGateway\tInterface\tMetric\n0.0.0.0\t0.0.0.0\t192.168.0.1\t192.168.0.100\t10\n127.0.0.0\t255.0.0.0\t127.0.0.1\t127.0.0.1\t1\n192.168.0.0\t255.255.255.0\t192.168.0.100\t192.168.0.100\t10\n192.168.0.100\t255.255.255.255\t127.0.0.1\t127.0.0.1\t10\n192.168.0.1\t255.255.255.255\t192.168.0.100\t192.168.0.100\t10\nThe columns Network destination and Netmask together describe the Network identifier as mentioned earlier. For example, destination 192.168.0.0 and netmask 255.255.255.0 can be written as 192.168.0.0/24.\nThe Gateway column contains the same information as the Next hop, i.e. it points to the gateway through which the network can be reached.\nThe Interface indicates what locally available interface is responsible for reaching the gateway. In this example, gateway 192.168.0.1 (the internet router) can be reached through the local network card with address 192.168.0.100.\nFinally, the Metric indicates the associated cost of using the indicated route. This is useful for determining the efficiency of a certain route from two points in a network. In this example, it is more efficient to communicate with the computer itself through the use of address 127.0.0.1 (called localhost) than it would be through 192.168.0.100 (the IP address of the local network card).\nForwarding table\nRouting tables are generally not used directly for packet forwarding in modern router architectures; instead, they are used to generate the information for a simpler forwarding table. This forwarding table contains only the routes which are chosen by the routing algorithm as preferred routes for packet forwarding. It is often in a compressed or pre-compiled format that is optimized for hardware storage and lookup.\nThis router architecture separates the control plane function of the routing table from the forwarding plane function of the forwarding table.[3] This separation of control and forwarding provides uninterrupted high-performance forwarding.\n◎ 俾 bǐ \n〈動〉\n(1) 使，把 [make]\n俾爾單厚。——《詩·小雅·天保》\n俾也可忘。——《詩·邶風·日月》\n苟入獄，不問罪之有無…俾困苦不堪。——清· 方苞《獄中雜記》\n又囑學使俾入邑庠。——《聊齋志異·促織》\n● 儔\nchóu  ㄔㄡˊ\n伴侶。唐•韓愈《送窮文》：「攜朋挈儔，去故就新。」元•關漢卿《竇娥冤•第一折》：「則被你坑殺人燕侶鶯儔。」\n同類、同輩。《文選•曹植•七啟》：「若夫田文無忌之儔，乃上古之俊公子也。」\n匹敵、相比。《文選•嵇康•幽憤詩》：「嗟我憤歎，曾莫能儔。」《文選•孔稚珪•北山移文》：「務光何足比，涓子不能儔。」\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/2020-feb/","title":"2020 Feb"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/2020-jan/":{"body":"Breed\n环境变量设置已成功更新，将在重启后生效。\n启用环境变量可以使 Breed 的一些设置能够被修改并保存。\n\n对于 TP-LINK 固件，请选择 [Breed 内部]，环境变量将储存在 Breed 分区末尾，更新 Breed 会导致环境变量数据丢失。\n对于 LSDK 和 QSDK 固件，请选择 [LSDK/QSDK]，更新 Breed 会导致环境变量被禁用，但不会清除环境变量数据。\n对于 AR724X 的 UBNT 固件，请选择 [UBNT.XM]，其特性与 [LSDK/QSDK] 相同。\n对于其它类型的固件，请选择 [Breed 内部]。\n\n请仅在十分熟悉固件结构、十分有把握的情况下，使用自定义位置。\n控制\t禁用 启用\n位置\t\n自定义\n起始地址\t\n大小 (字节)\t\n设置\nBoot and Recovery Environment for Embedded Devices (BREED)\nA multi-task bootloader with real-time firmware upgrading progress.\nNOT A U-BOOT MODIFICATION!\nCopyright (C) 2022 Weijie Gao\nRevision: r1416 [2022-07-24]\n当前版本：r1416 [2022-07-24]\n\nNetworking support   ---&gt;

PHP can have different configurations for the command-line interface (CLI) and the web server. If you are running your PHP script through a web server, the configuration should be updated in the web server's PHP configuration (e.g., /etc/php/7.x/apache2/php.ini). If you are using the PHP CLI, update the CLI's configuration (e.g., /etc/php/7.x/cli/php.ini).\nPermissions:\nEnsure that your web server process has read access to the php.ini file and the Expect extension files.\nThe choice between using PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) and mod_fastcgi depends on the web server you are using and your specific requirements. Both options provide FastCGI support for running PHP scripts, but they have different characteristics and may be better suited for different use cases:\nPHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager):\nPHP-FPM is a separate process manager for PHP that handles FastCGI requests. It's commonly used with web servers like Nginx and Apache. PHP-FPM has several advantages:\nPerformance: PHP-FPM is known for its high performance and low memory usage. It can handle a large number of PHP requests efficiently.\nIsolation: PHP-FPM separates PHP processes for different users or websites, providing better security and resource isolation.\nTuning: You can fine-tune PHP-FPM's configuration to control how PHP processes are managed, including the number of child processes and resource limits.\nScalability: PHP-FPM is suitable for environments where you need to scale PHP processes to handle varying levels of traffic.\nIf you are using Nginx or prefer a dedicated PHP process manager, PHP-FPM is a popular and efficient choice.\nlighttpd with fpm\nsudo apt install lighttpd php-fpm\nEdit the PHP-FPM configuration file to specify the socket or IP address where PHP-FPM will listen for FastCGI requests. The PHP-FPM configuration file is typically located at /etc/php//fpm/pool.d/www.conf. Adjust the configuration as needed.\nConfigure Lighttpd:\nConfigure Lighttpd to use FastCGI for PHP by editing its configuration file. This file is usually located at /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf. Here's a basic example of what you can add to this file:\nplaintext\nCopy code\nfastcgi.server = ( \".php\" =&gt;\n((\n\"socket\" =&gt; \"/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock\",\n\"broken-scriptfilename\" =&gt; \"enable\"\n))\n)\nAdjust the socket path and any other settings as per your PHP-FPM configuration.\nRestart Services:\nAfter configuring both PHP-FPM and Lighttpd, restart both services:\nbash\nCopy code\nsudo systemctl restart php7.4-fpm\nsudo systemctl restart lighttpd\nThis setup allows Lighttpd to communicate with PHP-FPM via FastCGI, enabling you to run PHP scripts efficiently and securely. Be sure to customize your configuration as needed to match your server's requirements.\n2023-10-11 17:44:09: (mod_fastcgi.c.451) FastCGI-stderr:PHP message: PHP Notice:  Use of undefined constant AssignTo - assumed 'AssignTo' in /disk/srv/box/boxuser.php on line 148\n??\nj/z/talezola/content/20\nTODO\n\n\nNoVNC\n\n\nNoSSH? to launch term or choose self run ones\n\n\nGet a token before the above step\n\n\nuse python pexpect, becuase php expect extension has no recent active releases for a long while\n\n\nadd fields, such as CPU arch\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/2020-jan/","title":"2020 Jan"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/2020-mar/":{"body":"光通信是一种利用光来携带信息的通信技术，也称为远程光通信。由人眼观察来解释信号，简单的信号如烽火、复杂的信号则如光编译的色码或闪光摩斯密码等。\n如烽火、液压电报、船只的旗帜、信号灯等是最早的光通信技术[1] [2] [3][4]。液压电报最早可以回溯到公元四世纪前的希腊。而在使用灯塔与导航灯防止船难的年代，海水手使用的求救信号弹也是一种光通信技术。\n掺铒光纤放大器（Erbium-doped Optical Fiber Amplifier，EDFA）的组成基本上包括了掺铒光纤，泵浦激光器，光合路器几个部分。基于不同的用途，掺铒光纤放大器已经发展出多种不同的结构。\nEDFA的放大原理与激光产生原理类似，光纤中掺杂的稀土族元素Er(3+)其亚稳态（meta-stable state）和基态（ground state）的能量差相当于1550nm光子的能量、\n当吸收适当波长的泵浦光能量（980nm或1480nm）后，电子会从基态跃迁到能阶较高的激发态（exciting state），接着释放少量能量转移到较稳定的亚稳态、在泵浦光源足够时铒离子的电子会发生居量反转（population inversion），即高能阶的亚稳态比能阶低的基态电子数量多、当适当的光信号通过时，亚稳态电子会发生受激辐射效应，放射出大量同波长光子、但因为存在振动能阶，所以波长不是单一而是一个范围，典型值为1530~1570nm、\n光放大器一般可以分为光纤放大器和半导体光放大器两种。光纤放大器还可以分为掺铒(Er)光纤放大器，掺镨(Pr)光纤放大器以及拉曼放大器等几种。其中掺铒光纤放大器工作于1550nm波长，已经广泛应用于光纤通信工业领域。掺镨的放大器可以工作于1310nm波长，但是由于转换效率不理想，现在仍然处于实验室研究阶段。拉曼放大器是近几年开始商用化的一种新型放大器，主要应用于需要分布式放大的场合。半导体光放大器结构小巧，方便集成，一直被很多人看好。但是由于偏振效应不太理想，一直没有大规模商用化。\nSolid state drive/Memory cell clearing\n== Enabling the Host Protected Area ==\n'''Warning: Only enable the Host Protected Area (HPA) on SSDs that do not contain any data. Otherwise, there is the threat of data loss.'''\nUnder normal circumstances, the '''host protected area''' is disabled. Thus, the SSD, in this example an [[Intel 320 Series SSDs|Intel 320 Series 160 GB SSD]], displays its normal net capacity (displayed in groups of 512-byte sectors).\n\nThese 312,581,808 sectors multiplied by 512 correspond to exactly 160,041,885,696 bytes, thus the normal net capacity of this SSD, precisely.\n'''hdparm -Np''' enables the host protected area. In doing this, the number of visible remaining sectors is specified after the –Np flag (without a space between). The --yes-i-know-what-i-am-doing flag and device name are required as additional parameters.\n\nCalling hdparam –N again confirms that the HPA has been unlocked.\n\n== HPA Unlocked Problem ==\nMany Linux distribution files enable the libata parameter, ignore_hpa.[http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/linux-kernel/2009/5/25/4447854/thread (PATCH 1/3) ide: add \"ignore_hpa\" module parameter] By doing so, the HPA will be disabled when the computer is next started or hot-plugging (for eSATA), which can lead to many problems.[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/380138 Bug #380138 in linux (Ubuntu): “Do NOT disable HPA by default -&gt; leads to data loss”] (bugs.launchpad.net)\nWhether ignore_hpa has been enabled or not can be determined by using the following command.\ncat /sys/module/libata/parameters/ignore_hpa\nIf the HPA will automatically be disabled as soon as an SSD with an HPA has been connected, \"1\" will be returned. The following example displays the /var/log/messages file for Ubuntu 10.10. The SSD has been connected to it using eSATA. The fourth line shows the disabling of the HPA (HPA unlocked).\n\n=== Affected Linux Systems ===\nMany Linux distribution files will be affected by this behavior, including:\n\nUbuntu 10.10\n\nA patch from Tejun Heo (with on-demand HPA unlocking) will resolve this problem.[http://lkml.org/lkml/2010/5/15/68 (PATCH 8/8) libata: implement on-demand HPA unlocking] (Linux Kernel Mailing List)[http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/git-commits-head/2010/6/3/41154 libata: implement on-demand HPA unlocking] (kerneltrap.org) Newer Linux kernels and Linux distribution files have already integrated this patch, including:\n\nUbuntu 11.04\n\nThe use of the HPA (HPA detected) will work with Ubuntu 11.04.\n\n=== Automatically Preventing HPA Disabling for Affected Linux Systems ===\n==== Temporarily ====\nignore_hpa can be temporarily disabled through the sysfs file system. This temporary change can be helpful, if an SSD with an HPA has been quickly connected to a computer. For SSDs that were already connected when the computer was started, a permanent solution will be required. The temporary setting will remain valid until the next reboot.\n\nThe HPA will now be used correctly (HPA detected: current 281323627, native 312581808):\n\n==== Permanently ====\nDepending on whether libdata has been compiled into the kernel or exists as a module, ignore_hpa can be permanently disabled as follows.\nFor libdata in the kernel:[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/380138/comments/13  Bug #380138 in linux (Ubuntu): “Do NOT disable HPA by default -&gt; leads to data loss”] (bugs.launchpad.net), Comment 13\n\nSupplement the libata.ignore_hpa=0 kernel flag in the boot loader configuration file\n\nFor libdata as a module:[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/380138/comments/15  Bug #380138 in linux (Ubuntu): “Do NOT disable HPA by default -&gt; leads to data loss”] (bugs.launchpad.net), Comment 15\n\nbash -c 'echo options libata ignore_hpa=0 &gt; /etc/modprobe.d/libata.conf' (as root or via sudo)\n\n闪存在分类上属于“EEPROM”的一种，但一般业界所讲的EEPROM指的是那种“非快闪式”的普通EEPROM，并不是指它。闪存以“宏块抹除”的方式改写其体内的资料，因为这种宏块的特性导致它的“写入速度”往往慢于“读取速度”，但也导致它的成本远远低于“以字节为单位写入”的普通EEPROM[1]。由于普通EEPROM需要一个一个比特的删除已有资料，这让其传输速度极其缓慢，相较之下快闪记体直接使用“宏块抹除”则会快得多，在会多次用到高清画面、高质量音乐的情况下尤为明显。\n闪存又分为NOR与NAND两型，闪存最常见的封装方式是TSOP48和BGA，在逻辑接口上的标准则由于厂商阵营而区分为两种：ONFI （页面存档备份，存于互联网档案馆）和Toggle。手机上的闪存常常以eMMC、UFS和NVME（特用于苹果设备中的闪存）的方式存在。\nSATA Secure Erase is basically the safest way to destroy data if you do not want to destroy the storage medium.\nWith all other solutions, data may remain under certain circumstances. The controller of an SSD, for example, distributes the write operations evenly across the cells. Thus, when using dd, one cannot be sure that all cells have been overwritten.\nHowever, because one often does not want to delete the entire HDD / SSD, I would therefore recommend to encrypt the storage devices.\nlsblk --fs\nNAME   FSTYPE LABEL      UUID                                 FSAVAIL FSUSE% MOUNTPOINT\nsda\n├─sda1 vfat              2539-7D44                             492,2M     2% /boot/efi\n├─sda2 ext4              c59a64bf-b464-4ea2-bf3a-d3fd9dded03f   67,9G    31% /\n└─sda3 swap              e96bee61-d116-4700-a761-c72153babfde                [SWAP]\n\ninxi --admin --disk\nDrives:\nID-1: /dev/sda vendor: Intenso model: SSD Sata III size: 111.79 GiB block size: physical: 512 B logical: 512 B\nsata: 3.2 speed: 6.0 Gb/s serial: AA000000000000035990 rev: 2A0 scheme: GPT\nSMART: yes state: enabled health: PASSED on: 54d 6h cycles: 227 read: 9.6 MiB written: 1.4 MiB\n\nhdparm -t /dev/sda\n/dev/sda:\nTiming buffered disk reads: 1572 MB in  3.00 seconds = 523.68 MB/sec\n\nhdparm -t /dev/sda2\n/dev/sda2:\nTiming buffered disk reads: 1542 MB in  3.00 seconds = 513.97 MB/sec\n\nhttps://fio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fio_doc.html\nMLC\n多层存储单元（Multi-Level Cell,MLC）可以在每个存储单元内存储2个以上的信息比特，其“多级”指的是电荷充电有多个能级（即多个电压值），如此便能存储多个比特的值于每个存储单元中。借由每个存储单元可存储更多的比特，MLC闪存可降低生产成本，但比起SLC闪存，其传输速度较慢，功率消耗较高和存储单元的寿命较低，因此MLC闪存技术会用在标准型的储存卡，也用在最常见的消费型固态硬盘和U盘上。另外，如飞索半导体的MirrorBit®技术，也是属于这一类技术。\nTLC\n三层储存单元（Triple-Level Cell, TLC），这种架构的原理与MLC类似，但可以在每个储存单元内储存3个信息比特。TLC的写入速度比SLC和MLC慢，寿命也比SLC和MLC短（使用LDPC的话，约有1500次），大约1000次。现在，厂商已不使用TLC这个名字，而是称其为3-bit MLC。[3]在使用3D技术取代微缩后，TLC(3D-TLC)成为市场主流。\nQLC\n四层储存单元（Quad-Level Cell, QLC），每个存储单元有4个bits的格式，寿命为四者之中最短，大约只有500次。\n在假设低电位表示二进制的0，高电位表示二进制的1时，SLC、MLC、TLC和QLC的电位及二进制值对比表。\n在表中可以清楚的看到SLC、MLC、TLC和QLC技术分别将单个存储单元划分为2/4/8/16阶，拿来存储1/2/3/4个二进制位数。\nSolid-State Drives (SSDs) have a so-called spare area, a data area that is not directly visible to the operating system. The SSD uses this spare area for wear leveling, among other things. Increasing the size of the spare area (over-provisioning) can increase performance and the life cycle of an SSD. This article will show how to increase the size of the spare area of a SATA SSD using hdparm under Linux by enabling the host protected area (ATA8-ACS SET MAX ADDRESS). The net usable capacity of the SSD will be reduced by doing so. The spare area section of the article about solid-state drives presents alternative methods for over-provisioning and other information.\nPreparation\nBefore increasing the size of the spare area, all SSD blocks must be deleted. Only in this manner can the SSD controller actually use the hidden data areas for wear leveling.\nAll SSD blocks will have been deleted, when:\nthe SSD is in its delivery state or\na secure erase or manual TRIM (depending on the specific SSD) has been performed\nThe hdparm tool for Linux provides an additional option, however the man page advises against using the option with hdparm version 9.27 (Ubuntu 10.10):\n\nStep 2: Set the User Passwords\nSo that you can execute a secure erase, you must first define a user password.

Write performance is known to degrade over time even on SSDs with native TRIM support. TRIM only safeguards against file deletes, not replacements such as an incremental save.\nNVMe SSD\nThe NVMe specification defines a standardized way to format NVMe drives, since those do not use the SATA interface protocol and therefore cannot be cleared in the same way as SATA SSDs.\nnvme id-ctrl /dev/nvme0 -H | grep \"Format |Crypto Erase|Sanitize\"\nExample output:\n[1:1] : 0x1\tFormat NVM Supported\n[29:29] : 0\tNo-Deallocate After Sanitize bit in Sanitize command Supported\n[2:2] : 0\tOverwrite Sanitize Operation Not Supported\n[1:1] : 0x1\tBlock Erase Sanitize Operation Supported\n[0:0] : 0x1\tCrypto Erase Sanitize Operation Supported\n[2:2] : 0x1\tCrypto Erase Supported as part of Secure Erase\n[1:1] : 0\tCrypto Erase Applies to Single Namespace(s)\n[0:0] : 0\tFormat Applies to Single Namespace(s)\nThe Format command is conceptually closer to a mix of hdparm and fdisk, as it allows to set low-level parameters for the drive and additionally to send a secure erase command.\nnvme-format(1) gives the following details about the Secure Erase Settings (-s , --ses=) option:\nSecure Erase Settings: This field specifies whether a secure erase should be performed as part of the format and the type of the secure erase operation. The erase applies to all user data, regardless of location (e.g., within an exposed LBA, within a cache, within deallocated LBAs, etc). Defaults to 0.\nPossible values :\nValue\tDefinitions\n0\tNo secure erase operation requested\n1\tUser Data Erase: All user data shall be erased, contents of the user data after the erase is indeterminate (e.g., the user data may be zero filled, one filled, etc). The controller may perform a cryptographic erase when a User Data Erase is requested if all user data is encrypted.\n2\tCryptographic Erase: All user data shall be erased cryptographically. This is accomplished by deleting the encryption key.\nWhile the Format command accepts either the whole NVMe character device (e.g. /dev/nvme0) or a specific namespace block device (e.g. /dev/nvme0n1), make sure this feature is supported by your drive before triggering it. E.g. in the output of the Identify Controller command above, we see that the Crypto Erase Applies to Single Namespace(s) and Format Applies to Single Namespace(s) bits are set to zero, which according to the spec means that \"the controller supports format on a per namespace basis\" (see figure 249 byte row 524 \"Format NVM Attributes (FNA)\").\nFor example, to format /dev/nvme0 with a crypto erase to namespace 1:\nnvme format /dev/nvme0 -s 2 -n 1\nUse -n 0xffffffff to format all the namespaces.\nSee nvme-format(1) for more information and important warnings regarding device/namespace selection.\nTUN\nThough both are for tunneling purposes, TUN and TAP can't be used together because they transmit and receive packets at different layers of the network stack. TUN, namely network TUNnel, simulates a network layer device and operates in layer 3 carrying IP packets. TAP, namely network TAP, simulates a link layer device and operates in layer 2 carrying Ethernet frames. TUN is used with routing. TAP can be used to create a user space network bridge.[2]\nApplications\nVirtual private networks\nOpenVPN, Ethernet/IP over TCP/UDP; encrypted, compressed\nZeroTier, Ethernet/IP over TCP/UDP; encrypted, compressed, cryptographic addressing scheme\nFreeLAN, open-source, free, multi-platform IPv4, IPv6 and peer-to-peer VPN software over UDP/IP.\nn2n, an open source Layer 2 over Layer 3 VPN application which uses a peer-to-peer architecture for network membership and routing\nTinc, Ethernet/IPv4/IPv6 over TCP/UDP; encrypted, compressed\nVTun, Ethernet/IP/serial/Unix pipe over TCP; encrypted, compressed, traffic-shaping\nOpenSSH\ncoLinux, Ethernet/IP over TCP/UDP\nHamachi\nOpenConnect\nWireGuard\nTailscale\nVirtual-machine networking\nBochs\ncoLinux\nHercules (S/390 emulator)\nOpen vSwitch\nQEMU/KVM\nUser-mode Linux\nVirtualBox\nTUN与TAP是操作系统内核中的虚拟网络设备。不同于普通靠硬件网络适配器实现的设备，这些虚拟的网络设备全部用软件实现，并向运行于操作系统上的软件提供与硬件的网络设备完全相同的功能。\nTAP等同于一个以太网设备，它操作第二层数据包如以太网数据帧。TUN模拟了网络层设备，操作第三层数据包比如IP数据包。\n操作系统通过TUN/TAP设备向绑定该设备的用户空间的程序发送数据，反之，用户空间的程序也可以像操作硬件网络设备那样，通过TUN/TAP设备发送数据。在后种情况下，TUN/TAP设备向操作系统的网络栈投递（或“注入”）数据包，从而模拟从外部接受数据的过程。\nTAYGA\nSimple, no-fuss NAT64 for Linux\nTAYGA is an out-of-kernel stateless NAT64 implementation for Linux that uses the TUN driver to exchange IPv4 and IPv6 packets with the kernel. It is intended to provide production-quality NAT64 service for networks where dedicated NAT64 hardware would be overkill.\nTAYGA is:\n\n\nFast — can saturate gigabit Ethernet on modest PC hardware\n\n\nFlexible — performs dynamic mapping to handle any site addressing scheme\n\n\nSecure — runs outside of the kernel as an unprivileged process\n\n\nCompatible — works with all Linux 2.4 and 2.6 kernels\n\n\nSimple — requires only a five-line configuration file (three lines in some cases)\n\n\nEasy to install — no kernel patches or external dependencies required\n\n\nhttp://www.litech.org/tayga/\n\n\nThe latest release of TAYGA is version 0.9.2, released on 2011-06-10.\nSuper-quick-start\nYou will need to select an unused /96 from your site's IPv6 address range which will be used as the NAT64 prefix. You will also need a block of unused IPv4 addresses for the dynamic address pool. TAYGA will assign IPv4 addresses from this pool to the IPv6 hosts that need NAT64 service. The dynamic pool can be chosen from private IPv4 address space (10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, etc) and can be of any size, although it needs to be large enough to contain one IPv4 address for every IPv6 host that needs to use the NAT64.\nTAYGA also needs its own IPv4 address, but this can be taken from the dynamic address pool.\n./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install\nmkdir -p /var/db/tayga\ncat &gt;/usr/local/etc/tayga.conf &lt;&lt;EOD\ntun-device nat64\nipv4-addr 192.168.255.1                  (this is TAYGA's IPv4 address, not your router's address)\nprefix 2001:db8:1:ffff::/96              (replace with an unused /96 prefix from your site's address range)\ndynamic-pool 192.168.255.0/24\ndata-dir /var/db/tayga\nEOD\ntayga --mktun\nip link set nat64 up\nip addr add 192.168.0.1 dev nat64      (replace with your router's IPv4 address)\nip addr add 2001:db8:1::1 dev nat64    (replace with your router's IPv6 address)\nip route add 192.168.255.0/24 dev nat64\nip route add 2001:db8:1:ffff::/96 dev nat64\ntayga\nping6 2001:db8:1:ffff::192.168.0.1\nIf the ping6 command succeeds, TAYGA is working. Now you'll need to set up NAT44 rules in iptables or elsewhere on your network so the dynamic pool addresses can reach the rest of the Internet.\nFull documentation about the configuration and operation of TAYGA can be found in the man pages and README file accompanying the distribution.\nDNS64\nISC BIND supports DNS64 since version 9.8 and is the best option for DNS64 services. Another option is Totd, although it has not been updated in some years.\nWhat about stateful NAT?\nTAYGA could never come close to offering the power and flexibility available in iptables and mature commercial NAT44 implementations, so instead TAYGA turns IPv6 into IPv4 in the most transparent manner possible, allowing existing IPv4-only tools to be used to further manipulate sessions flowing through it.\nIn other words, if you need stateful NAT64, route TAYGA's IPv4 path through a stateful NAT44.\nBriny, Brackish, Saline\nGFWList\nRule List Config\nRule List Format SwitchyAutoProxy\nRule List URL\nhttps://gitlab.com/gfwlist/gfwlist/raw/master/gfwlist.txt\nThe rule list will be updated from this URL.

Linux 里只要数分钟就能编译完成的 libgcc.a 在 Windows 里面需要半个小时以上才能完成，而且到最后使用 ar 命令将一堆 .o 文件合并为 .a 时，居然因为命令行超过 32KB 而导致命令执行失败。到最后是直接使用了 Linux 里面编译好的文件。\n哎。。。这都是 Windows 过于复杂的进程创建机制导致的。。。\n最近打算更新 MinGW 环境，发现 mingw-w64

runtime is a set of execution startup routines that perform initialization work before calling the program's main function. It is a basic runtime library/system.\nGCC ClooG is a free software tool that is used to generate code for loops in computer programs.\nClooG stands for “Code Generation Library for Optimized Code Generation” and is used to generate code for loops that are optimized for performance. It is particularly useful for optimizing code that is executed frequently or that has a high level of complexity.\nGCC ClooG works by analyzing the structure of a loop and generating code that is optimized for the specific characteristics of the loop. It can generate code for loops that are written in C, C++, or other languages that are supported by GCC.\nTo use GCC ClooG, you will need to install the GCC compiler on your computer and then invoke the ClooG tool from the command line. You will need to provide the source code for the loop that you want to optimize and specify any optimization options that you want to use. GCC ClooG will then generate optimized code for the loop, which you can incorporate into your program.\nfastcgi.server = ( \".php\" =&gt;\n((\n\"socket\" =&gt; \"/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock\",\n\"broken-scriptfilename\" =&gt; \"enable\"\n))\n)\nErr:16 http://linux.dropbox.com/debian bookworm InRelease\nHit:5 https://linux-clients.seafile.com/seafile-deb/focal stable InRelease\nroot@x2:~\nproxychains sudo apt update\n[proxychains] config file found: /etc/proxychains4.conf\n[proxychains] preloading /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproxychains.so.4\n[proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.16\nroot@x2:~\nproxychains apt update\n[proxychains] config file found: /etc/proxychains4.conf\n[proxychains] preloading /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libproxychains.so.4\n[proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.16\n[proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.16\n[proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.16\n[proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.16\n[proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.16\n[proxychains] DLL init: proxychains-ng 4.16\n0% [Connecting to dl.google.com (224.0.0.1)] [Connecting to mirrors.ustc.edu.cn (224.0.0.1)] [Connecting [0% [Connecting to dl.google.com (224.0.0.1)] [Connecting to mirrors.ustc.edu.cn (224.0.0.1)] [Connecting &lt;--socket error or timeout!\n快点超时，快点恢复。\nSSH 访问\nDropbear 提供 SSH 访问和 SCP 服务\nDropbear 实例\n删除\n接口\nlan: 软件 VLAN: \"eth0.1\"无线网络: Master \"pikachu\"\n▾\n仅监听指定的接口，未指定则监听全部\n端口\n22\n密码验证\n允许 SSH 密码验证\n允许 root 用户凭密码登录\n允许 root 用户凭密码登录\n网关端口\n允许远程主机连接到本地 SSH 转发端口\n状态\n系统\n主机名\tOpenWrt\n型号\tTP-Link TL-WR2041N v1\n架构\tAtheros AR9344 rev 2\n固件版本\tOpenWrt 19.07.7 r11306-c4a6851c72 / LuCI openwrt-19.07 branch git-21.044.30835-34e0d65\n内核版本\t4.14.221\n内存\n可用数\n已使用\n已缓冲\n已缓存\n网络\nIPv4 上游\n协议: DHCP 客户端\n地址: 10.151.24.27/23\n网关: 10.151.24.1\nDNS 1: 202.106.0.20\nDNS 2: 114.114.114.114\n设备: 以太网适配器: \"eth1\"\nMAC 地址: 28:2C:B2:3F:8B:DE\n已分配的 DHCPv6 租约\n主机\tIPv6 地址\tDUID\t剩余租赁时间\nDESKTOP-ORR1POT (DESKTOP-ORR1POT.lan)\tfd55:ef68:3c30::667\t000100012a07982db083fe6fe8aa\t8h 34m 43s\nhelenyao\tfd55:ef68:3c30::a2a\t00010001251a687eb083fe6ff8bb\t4h 57m 49s\nDESKTOP-MANDY (DESKTOP-MANDY.lan)\n无线\nradio0\n类型: MAC80211 802.11bgn\n信道: 11 (2.462 GHz)\n传输速率: 91 Mbit/s\n信号: -49 dBm / 质量: 87%\nSSID: pikachu\n模式: Master\nBSSID: 28:2C:B2:3F:8B:DD\n加密: WPA2 PSK (CCMP)\nradio0\n类型: MAC80211 802.11bgn\n信道: 11 (2.462 GHz)\n传输速率: 90 Mbit/s\n信号: -49 dBm / 质量: 87%\nSSID: pikachu\n模式: Master\nBSSID: 28:2C:B2:3F:8B:DD\n加密: WPA2 PSK (CCMP)\n关联数: 8\n已连接站点\n网络\tMAC 地址\t主机\t信号 / 噪声\t接收速率 / 发送速率\n主设备 \"pikachu\" (wlan1)\nFC:B3:BC:58:A7:B9\tdebian12.lan (192.168.1.175, fe80::feb3:bcff:fe58:a7b9)\n-41/-95 dBm\n130.0 Mbit/s, 20 MHz, MCS 15\n57.8 Mbit/s, 20 MHz, MCS 5, Short GI\n主设备 \"pikachu\" (wlan1)\nBC:85:56:60:6A:93\tx2.lan (192.168.1.168, fe80::96a2:352:586a:7c2b)\n-65/-95 dBm\n52.0 Mbit/s, 20 MHz, MCS 5\n58.5 Mbit/s, 20 MHz, MCS 6\n活动的 IPv4 路由\n网络\t目标\tIPv4 网关\t跃点数\t表\nwan\t0.0.0.0/0\t10.151.24.1\t0\tmain\nwan\t10.151.24.0/23\t-\t0\tmain\nlan\t192.168.1.0/24\t-\t0\tmain\nPowered by LuCI openwrt-19.07 branch (git-21.044.30835-34e0d65) / OpenWrt 19.07.7 r11306-c4a6851c72\nuci add dropbear dropbear # =cfg024dd4\n刷新\n负载\n流量\n无线\n连接\neth0.1\neth1\nbr-lan\neth0\nwlan1\n$ ssh root@192.168.1.1\nUnable to negotiate with 192.168.1.1 port 22: no matching host key type found.

The signature type ssh-rsa refers to RSA with SHA-1, whereas the signature type rsa-sha2-256 is RSA with SHA-256 and rsa-sha2-512 is RSA with SHA-512.\nIn the case of Azure DevOps, it only supports the kind of RSA with SHA-1, and SHA-1 is considered very weak. This essentially means that there are no secure ways to connect to it over SSH, and until they fix that, you're better off using HTTPS or a different hosting service. GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket all support secure methods of authentication.\nIf you really need to use SSH with Azure DevOps at the moment, you can add an entry to your ~/.ssh/config file to work around this:\nHost ssh.dev.azure.com\nUser git\nPubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa\nHostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa\nHowever, be aware that this is a workaround and it's known to be insecure, so you should contact Azure DevOps about this problem and switch to HTTPS until they do, or move elsewhe\n64 bytes from 192.168.1.152: icmp_seq=7 ttl=64 time=1.86 ms\nFrom 169.254.243.97: icmp_seq=15 Redirect Host(New nexthop: 192.168.1.152)\n64 bytes from 192.168.1.152: icmp_seq=16 ttl=64 time=98.8 ms\n-$template mytemplate, \"%timegenerated:1:6% %$year% %timegenerated:8:15% %$myhostname% %programname% %syslogfacility-text%.%syslogpriority-text% :%msg%\\n\"\n-$template servertemplate, \"&lt;%PRI%&gt;%timegenerated:1:6% %timegenerated:8:15% %$myhostname% :%msg%\"\n+$template mytemplate, \"%timegenerated:1:10:date-rfc3339% %timegenerated:12:23:date-rfc3339% %HOSTNAME% %syslogfacility-text%.%syslogpriority-text% :%msg%\\n\"\n+$template servertemplate, \"&lt;%PRI%&gt;%HOSTNAME% %timegenerated:1:10:date-rfc3339% %timegenerated:12:23:date-rfc3339% %syslogfacility-text%.%syslogpriority-text% :%msg%\"\n12345678\nsendto in send_ip_packet_sd: sendto(4, packet, 44, 0, 10.151.0.0, 16) =&gt; Network is unreachable\nOffending packet: TCP 10.151.54.101:52530 &gt; 10.151.0.0:6543 S ttl=41 id=42932 iplen=44  seq=2466713721 win=1024 &lt;mss 1460&gt;\nsendto in send_ip_packet_sd: sendto(4, packet, 44, 0, 10.151.0.3, 16) =&gt; Network is unreachable\nOffending packet: TCP 10.151.54.101:52530 &gt; 10.151.0.3:10621 S ttl=50 id=21350 iplen=44  seq=2466713721 win=1024 &lt;mss 1460&gt;\nsendto in send_ip_packet_sd: sendto(4, packet, 44, 0, 10.151.0.6, 16) =&gt; Network is unreachable\nOffending packet: TCP 10.151.54.101:52530 &gt; 10.151.0.6:617 S ttl=46 id=5440 iplen=44  seq=2466713721 win=1024 &lt;mss 1460&gt;\nsendto in send_ip_packet_sd: sendto(4, packet, 44, 0, 10.151.0.9, 16) =&gt; Network is unreachable\nOffending packet: TCP 10.151.54.101:52530 &gt; 10.151.0.9:3920 S ttl=46 id=54123 iplen=44  seq=2466713721 win=1024 &lt;mss 1460&gt;\nsendto in send_ip_packet_sd: sendto(4, packet, 44, 0, 10.151.0.12, 16) =&gt; Network is unreachable\nOffending packet: TCP 10.151.54.101:52530 &gt; 10.151.0.12:1069 S ttl=46 id=32418 iplen=44  seq=2466713721 win=1024 &lt;mss 1460&gt;\nOmitting future Sendto error messages now that 10 have been shown.

A personal computer or virtual machine runs software to perform the network emulation; a dedicated emulation device is sometimes used for link emulation.\nNetworks introduce delay, errors, and drop packets. The primary goal of network emulation is to create an environment whereby users can connect the devices, applications, products, and/or services being tested to validate their performance, stability, or functionality against real-world network scenarios. Once tested in a controlled environment against actual network conditions, users can have confidence that the item being tested will perform as expected.\nEmulation, simulation, and traffic generation\nEmulation differs from simulation in that a network emulator appears to be a network; end-systems such as computers can be attached to the emulator and will behave as if they are attached to a network. A network emulator mirrors the network which connects end-systems, not the end-systems themselves.\nNetwork simulators are typically programs that run on a single computer, take an abstract description of the network traffic such as a flow arrival process, and yield performance statistics such as throughput, delay, loss etc.\nThese products are typically found in the Development and QA environments of Service Providers, Network Equipment Manufacturers, and Enterprises.\nNetwork emulation software\nSoftware developers typically want to analyze the response time and sensitivity to packet loss of client-server applications and emulate specific network effects (of 5G, Smart homes, industrial IOT, military networks, etc.,) with different round-trip-times, throughputs, bit error rates, and packet drops.\nTwo open-source network emulators are Common Open Research Emulator (CORE) and Extendable Mobile Ad hoc Network Emulator (EMANE). They both support operation as network black boxes, i.e. external machines/devices can be hooked up to the emulated network with no knowledge of emulation. They also support both wired and wireless network emulation with various degrees of fidelity. A CORE is more useful for quick network layouts (layer 3 and above) and single-machine emulation. EMANE is better suited for distributed high-fidelity large-scale network emulation (layers 1/2).\nThe most popular network simulation software packages, OPNET and Tetcos NetSim, also have emulation modules for real-time device connectivity. In general simulation tools with emulation capabilities provide more sophistication than emulation devices. Emulation devices only provide for emulation of the physical link and do not factor in the effects of the higher layers (MAC, network, transport, etc.). Simulation tools however model effects from different layers of the network stack when running in emulation mode. They would allow for connecting multiple sources/destinations, routers, base stations, MANET protocols, etc.\nTraffic generation software\nThe network performance under maximum throughput conditions can be analyzed by network traffic measurement in a testbed network, using a network traffic generator such as iperf. The traffic generator sends dummy packets, often with a unique packet identifier, making it possible to keep track of the packet delivery in the network using a network analyzer.\nriting Bash scripts, it's important to handle options and arguments effectively to make your scripts user-friendly and versatile. There are several ways to do this, but the most common methods include using getopts, getopt, or manually parsing arguments. Here's a brief overview of these options:\ngetopts:\ngetopts is a built-in Bash command for parsing command-line options. It's simple and lightweight, but it may not support complex option configurations.\nbash\nCopy code\nwhile getopts \":a:b:c\" opt; do\ncase $opt in\na)\narg_a=\"$OPTARG\"\n;;\nb)\narg_b=\"$OPTARG\"\n;;\nc)\narg_c=true\n;;\n?)\necho \"Invalid option: -$OPTARG\" &gt;&amp;2\nexit 1\n;;\nesac\ndone\nWith getopts, you specify which options your script should accept and whether they require arguments.\ngetopt:\ngetopt is a more flexible option that can handle complex options and long-form flags. It's not built into Bash, so you'll need to use an external command. The syntax can be a bit more complex.\nbash\nCopy code\nargs=$(getopt -o a:b:c --long arg-a:,arg-b:,arg-c -- \"$@\")\neval set -- \"$args\"\nwhile true; do\ncase \"$1\" in\n-a|--arg-a)\narg_a=\"$2\"\nshift 2\n;;\n-b|--arg-b)\narg_b=\"$2\"\nshift 2\n;;\n-c|--arg-c)\narg_c=true\nshift\n;;\n--)\nshift\nbreak\n;;\nesac\ndone\ngetopt is more powerful and flexible but requires more code.\nManual Argument Parsing:\nIf you have very specific or custom argument parsing requirements, you can manually parse command-line arguments using loops and conditionals. This method provides the most control but requires more effort.\nbash\nCopy code\nwhile [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do\ncase \"$1\" in\n-a)\narg_a=\"$2\"\nshift 2\n;;\n-b)\narg_b=\"$2\"\nshift 2\n;;\n-c)\narg_c=true\nshift\n;;\n*)\necho \"Invalid option: $1\" &gt;&amp;2\nexit 1\n;;\nesac\ndone\nThe choice of which method to use depends on the complexity of your script and your preference. For simple scripts, getopts is often sufficient. For more complex cases, getopt or manual parsing might be more suitable. Additionally, consider providing clear usage instructions for your script using the --help option to make it user-friendly.\nembed jekyll seo tags into templates\ndebug\nhijacking into anti-zha site\nssl vpn, l2tp vpn\n南京这边是电信专线20M，送了一个千兆民用宽带\n北京是第三方的，电信的网，50M\nhttps://mah2eds8ab.feishu.cn/sheets/WcMJs6YfxhAIcLtz7IucsDxHnqg?sheet=MgLhF9\nhttps://mah2eds8ab.feishu.cn/sheets/WcMJs6YfxhAIcLtz7IucsDxHnqg\nOA\nhttps://mah2eds8ab.feishu.cn/docx/N8OydmjrfoEuI1xhaR2czYQ0nCd?from=from_copylink\n电视\n主机\n摄像头\n麦克风\n无线键鼠\n排插\n电视支架\n可以换新的？\n北京南京导入资产明细\nhttps://mah2eds8ab.feishu.cn/sheets/JUSzsX5VqhBYsFtzSToc8ny0nBb?sheet=y9UGLX\nbj这边网络设备，\n1 Hillstone SG 6000 m6010，设备陈旧，ssl/ssh 协议都不再有支持，这两年都无法连接配置，申请替换。\n1 H3C AP\n2 tp-link AP\n1 Dell N3224 交换机\n现在出口应该是一个批发转售的电信通，速率差，申请出口100Mbps起。\n管理网页的HTTPS是SSL 1.0的，现在主流浏览器默认的安全规则不允许打开\nipsecvpn\n要打通南京和北京的内网吗？\n2 replies\n11:34\n这样的话sslvpn没有ipsecvpn使用方便\n北京：36个固定工位+共享办公区6-8人\n南京：22个固定工位\n北京南京在开启研发人员招聘，多语言销售人员招聘，可能也会开启多语言业务市场人员招聘，那么北京和南京的办公网络需要按照办公室的工位数量去配嘞：\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/2020-mar/","title":"2020 Mar"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/a-mobx-introduction/":{"body":"MobX (previously mobservable) is a state management library for JavaScript frontend application. This article introduces it with examples as well as showing how it works in a real app with TypeScript. It is based on a talk I gave at the Osaka Web designers and developers meetup recently.\nWhat is MobX and why should I look into it\nMobX?\nLet's start by explaining what is MobX and how it works. It's presented as using Transparent Functional Reactive Programming.\nNow, FRP is a very controversial term as everyone seems to have their own definition so let's forget about that and look at a illustration from the MobX docs (click on it to open in a new tab and get full size or open this link).\n\n\nIn short, actions modify the state, which triggers reactions. Part of the state can be derived automatically, such as the number of tasks left to do in a TODO list to take the example of the picture above.\nWhat sets MobX apart from other Observable implementations is the transparent part. Reactions observe which observables you are using and subscribe to them automatically, without you having to explicitely subscribe to those.\nBefore we continue, a few more things:\n\nwhile some of the examples use React, MobX is not tied to any particular framework\nit is written in TypeScript so you get type definitions out of the box if you are using TypeScript\nthe learning curve is very small and you will be able to start an app by the end of that article\n\nWhy would I use it instead of Redux/ImmutableJS or library X?\nThis part is written from my experience using both Redux/ImmutableJS and MobX with React in Proppy, our app to write proposals for freelancers and small agencies/companies. Its frontend is written in TypeScript, which was one of a big reason to moving to MobX as we will see in a bit.\nOur issues with Redux/ImmutableJS were twofold.\nThe first issue was that it is very verbose. You need to write an action, the reducer function, a selector and then connect the actions and the data on the React components.\nThe second issue only occurs if you are using TypeScript like us. You also need to add the types of actions and data at each step and sometimes even repeat them if you are passing down actions to dumb components. We were also using ImmutableJS records with maps in them which meant the code was very often stringly typed. For example, getting a value using .getIn([\"blocks\", id, \"data\", \"value\"]) was common and there was no typecheck whatsoever.\nWith MobX we only have to mention the types and, as we will see when showing examples of Proppy, get full typechecking as we are only dealing with plain JavaScript objects.\nNote that using MobX means you have to give up immutability, which could be a showstopper for you.\nMobX by example\nThis section is a brief introduction to MobX. If you have already used it, you can safely skip to the next section to see some patterns/snippets from a live application.\nNote that I will use ES6 syntax and decorators throughout the examples but it works in plain ES5 as well.\nObserving arrays and map changes with autorun\nLet's start with observing arrays and maps, as it constitutes a big chunk of what we would want\nto observe.\n\nTo show the changes to observable values, we will use the autorun function provided by the mobx package. This function takes a function as argument and call it once to detect which observables are being used in it and subscribe to them.\n\nWe will show in the next section that autorun doesn't actually run everytime any observable is modified like the example above might indicate but only when one of those used in the function are modified.\nObserving class properties and transactions\nThe other thing that we typically want to observe are class properties.\n\nIn that example, both name and numberPeople are observable properties of the thisMeetup object but only numberPeople is used in the autorun function. Therefore, the following snippet will not print anything:\n\nRemember the T part of TFRP? MobX automatically figured out which observable to subscribe to and has done so transparently.\nReactions are synchronous so you might wonder how to avoid \"useless\" reactions, e.g. when setting multiple observables at once such as when receiving a response from a AJAX request. transaction solves that issue by not triggering reactions until the end of the function.\n\nIn the example above, autorun only runs once: with numberPeople equal to 4, not with the intermediate 2 and 3.\nComputed values\nIn some cases, data can be derived directly from the state. To take a simplified example from Proppy, we are going to look at a row in a cost table: we have quantity and unit price and can therefore automatically calculate the total.\ncomputed is lazy (won't be evaluated unless needed in a reaction) and it is memoized (if the observables used inside didn't change, it doesn't need to re-run and can return the current value).\n\nNote that @computed can only be used on getter in a class.\nActions\nActions are functions that modify the state.\nWhile, as shown in the previous examples, we can simply modify the object directly, it is not the recommended way to do so.\nThe recommended way is to wrap any actions that modify the state with the action function or decorator. This will accomplish a few things:\n\nwrap the function in a transaction automatically\nprovide debugging info for that state change that can be displayed in dev tools\n\nYou can force your app to only modify state through actions by using useStrict(true) in your app.\n\nWe don't use the strict mode ourselves\nMobX in real life\nNow that you know the basics of MobX, it's time to see how it looks in production.\nIt's currently the backbone of our frontend app in Proppy so we will use examples from it.\nIf you are doing SSR, be aware that the way we handle stores shown below will not work for you.\nConverting Proppy to use MobX took about 4 days, numerous long-standing issues were fixed along the way and the end result was a deletion of around 1000 to 2000 lines (estimate as we also moved to use npm @types for typings in that branch).\nStores\nOur stores are simple singleton classes that have observable properties.\nHere's a shorter version of one of our stores, dealing with clients for proposals.\n\nQuite simple stuff.\nYou can see we are calling another store from our store. That would be a big no-no in Redux and we were using a middleware to solve that previously.\nIt feels much nicer now: we have a full view of what's happening and it's very easy to see if something is missing (which was actually the case for some ajax requests).\nThis example doesn't really show it but every data stored in a store is typed and trying to access client.random would be a compiler error.\nIt really shines for complex objects like cost tables that were previously a simple map with no schema and are now fully typed objects with functions of their own. Thanks to that, we moved things such as calculating totals to the cost table class rather than a React component like before.\nComponents\nWe're using the mobx-react package that gives us the observer decorator that we put on top of a component.\nDoing so gives us the same thing as the autorun in the MobX by example section: when an observable used in the render function changes, the component will be re-rendered.\n@observer also comes with an optimized shouldComponentUpdate that works very well in our experience: the only shouldComponentUpdate left in our code are the ones impossible to not handle manually due to contenteditable.\nSince we don't do server side rendering, we can directly import a store and call its function directly. Here's a slightly modified code sample for the Settings&gt;Clients page:\n\nNo ceremony needed, everything works out of the box as if I was just dealing with plain JavaScript objects. All the store functions and data are typed too. Trying to call clientStore.deleteClient(\"1\") for example would be a compilation error and I only had to write the type once: in the store as shown before.\nAnother aspect not mentioned before is that you can also use observable to remove the need for React state.\nRather than having a state and updating it with this.setState, you can just update your variable directly and it will re-render the component if that property is used in the render method.\nTo use the previous example, if I wanted to display a banner after adding a client in that component I could set this.client = true and render something different when this.client is true. No more this.setState({..} as any) to satisfy the TypeScript compiler.\nAnother neat thing about using MobX for state is that changes will be logged if you are using dev tools.\nDev tools\nFor React, mobx-react-devtools is available and is pretty great. See the gif below from its repo to have an overview of the 3 features.\n\n\nI have mostly used the logging to inspect action and state changes while debugging and to spot erroneous updates and the re-rendering highlighter to figure out if some of our components were re-rendering too often.\nUseful links\n\nOfficial docs and in particular Common pitfalls &amp; best practices and What does MobX reacts to?\nIn-depth explanation of MobX\nUnderstanding MobX and when to use it\nExample: real-life with router/ajax etc\n\nConclusion\nOverall, we are very happy with the transition to MobX and would recommend investigating it if you are looking for a state management solution, especially if you are using TypeScript or Flow.\nI'm pretty impressed by the constant work the TypeScript team has accomplished and highly recommend it as well if you are planning to stay on the JavaScript side and not go for Elm/PureScript/etc.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/a-mobx-introduction/","title":"A MobX introduction and case study"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/announcing-gutenberg/":{"body":"Why would we possibly want another static site engine?

Sadly, I didn't find a template engine I liked at the time which\nprompted me to write my own, Tera.\nNow that Tera is getting more mature and my frustration with Go templates grows, I started\nworking again on the static site engine a few weeks ago and it got to a point where it's usable.\nIt's called Gutenberg and is now available in a 0.0.2 version on crates.io and Github.\nIt seems AppVeyor is running into some issue with curl so I haven't been able to test it on Windows yet but\nit should work on Linux and OSX. Binaries are built using the very nice trust project.\nThe features\nGutenberg is opinionated (only TOML for configuration, only Tera for templates, only CommonMark for content) but is flexible\nenough to let you build all kinds of sites, from landing pages to knowledge bases, not only blogs.\nFeatures in no particular order are:\n\nCommonMark for content\nCategories and Tags automatic page creation (easy to disable)\nAutomatic RSS feed (easy to disable)\nBuilt-in server with fast live reload (a bit buggy currently)\nSupports having assets next to the content: no need to put everything in a static folder\nExplicit sections that can have their own page and have access to potential subsections: this allows making pages like https://easyengine.io/tutorials/\nwhich are a big table of contents over several sections\nGood template engine: I'm a bit biased there\nSimple to use: no surprises, everything is explicit except from the default templates used\n\nMore information is available on the README and better documentation will come\nonce the tool is in a more stable shape.\nWhat's next\nAs the 0.0.2 version number indicates, Gutenberg is still a work-in-progress. Despite\nthat, it fills almost all my static engine needs. There are a few things that will need\nto be done before being ready for a 0.1 though:\n\nFind and fix bugs, add tests and benchmarks\nMake it faster: parallelize if possible\nPagination: still debating the best way to set up that up in a Github issue\nAdd an equivalent to Hugo shortcodes: they make it easy to embed\nsome HTML in your markdown without repeating HTML all the time, e.g. a youtube video could be added to a page like so {{ youtube(id=87238) }}\nand the renderer will insert whatever template we defined for the youtube shortcode.\n\nAnd for after the 0.1 release:\n\nBuilt-in Jupyter renderer would be nice\nProper documentation site\n\nThe current blocker to parallelization is that syntect, the\ngreat library I'm using for syntax highlighting is not thread-safe. There is an issue open\nbut I haven't had the time or energy to look/fix that yet.\nIt should be fairly straightforward to add Rayon once it's fixed, if the benchmarks show a significant difference.\nHow does it look in practice\nYou can have a look at the source of this site.\nThis site is very simple: a blog and a couple of other pages but it should give some ideas.\nEnjoy!\nObviously, any feedback is welcome!\nWhile the general design and current features are unlikely to change, I'd be happy to cover\nmore use-cases if possible.\nCheck it out on Github: Gutenberg\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/announcing-gutenberg/","title":"Announcing Gutenberg, a static site engine"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/asan/":{"body":"AddressSanitizer is a fast memory error detector.

When the free function is called, it marks the region as off-limits and adds it to a quarantine queue, which delays when that memory can be reused by the malloc function. All memory accesses in the code are transformed by the compiler according to Listing 1.\n\nWhen code is run with ASan enabled, any access to a memory region that's off-limits results in an error reported by the Address Sanitizer.\nPerformance Impact\nRunning your code with Address Sanitizer checks enabled typically results in CPU slowdown of 2⨉ to 5⨉, and an increase in memory usage by 2⨉ to 3⨉. You can improve memory utilization by compiling at the -O1 optimization level.\nFor most use cases, the overhead introduced by the Address Sanitizer should be acceptable for daily use during development—in fact, you may not even notice any slowdown.\nhttps://llvm.org/devmtg/2013-11/slides/Serebryany-ASAN.pdf\n● ~2x slowdown\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/code_diagnostics/address_sanitizer/\n\nLimitations\nAddressSanitizer uses more real memory than a native run. How much -- depends on the allocations sizes. The smaller the allocations you make the bigger the overhead.\nOn 64-bit platforms AddressSanitizer maps (but not reserves) 16+ Terabytes of virtual address space. This means that tools like ulimit may not work as usually expected.\nStatic linking is not supported.\nAs a runtime diagnostic, the Address Sanitizer can only detect memory errors that are encountered during program execution. To exercise the full extent of your code, incorporate comprehensive unit tests.\nThe Address Sanitizer cannot detect memory leaks, access to uninitialized memory, or integer overflow. However, you can use ASan in addition to TSan, UBSan, and Instruments to find additional issues.\nSanitization is performed on heap and stack buffers as well as on global variables. Buffer overflow and underflow can result in a crash or other unpredictable behavior.\nGlobal, Heap, and Stack Overflows in C\nIn the following example, the global_array, heap_buffer, and stack_buffer variables each have valid indexes in the range [0, 9], but are accessed at index 10, causing an overflow.\n\nAdd a bounds check before attempting to access a buffer at an index.\nOverflow of C++ Containers\nThis check detects when a libc++ container is accessed beyond the region [container.begin(), container.end()) — even when the accessed memory is in a heap-allocated buffer used internally by a container.\nThis check is disabled by default, because it requires that all statically linked libraries using std::vector are built with Address Sanitizer enabled.\n\nSiblings:\n\n\nThreadSanitizer (TSan): data races\n\n\nMemorySanitizer (MSan): uses of uninitialized memory\n\n\nASan: stack unwinding with frame pointers\n\n\nTSan: catching synchronization via atomics\n\n\nMSan: avoid false positives\n\n\nvim中搜索能不带括号？\nheap use after free\nWhen you have multiple copies of the same pointer, e.g.\nint *p1 = malloc(sizeof (int));\nint *p2 = p1;\nint *p3 = p2;\nthen freeing any of them invalidates all of them:\nfree(p2);\n// Now p1, p2, p3 have invalid values.\n// The C standard calls these \"indeterminate values\"; accessing them has undefined behavior\nYou can manually set p2 to NULL after freeing, but that still leaves p1 and p3 dangling. You cannot automatically find all copies of a pointer value that may exist anywhere in your program's memory.\nASan report example: heap-use-after-free\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\nint *array = new int[100];\ndelete [] array;\nreturn array[argc]; // BOOM\n}\n\nLeakSanitizer (ASan’s leak detector)\n\nSimilar to other tools: tcmalloc, valgrind, etc\nFaster than any of those\n○ No extra overhead on top of ASan at run-time\n○ Small overhead at shutdown\nBased on the ASan/MSan/TSan allocator\nCan be bundled with ASan/MSan/TSan or used as a standalone tool\n○ Currently, supported only in ASan or standalone\nRequires StopTheWorld() -- today Linux only\n\n[1] ASAN_OPTIONS=check_initialization_order=true\n[2] ASAN_OPTIONS=strict_init_order=true (has false positives).\nASan report example: stack-use-after-scope\nint main() {\nint *p;\n{ int x = 0; p = &amp;x; }\nreturn *p;\n}\n% clang -g -fsanitize=address,use-after-scope a.cc ; ./a.\nout\n==15839==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: stack-use-after-scope\nREAD of size 4 at 0x7fffe06c20a0 thread T0\n#0 0x46103d in main a.cc:4\nAddress is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 160 in\nframe\n#0 0x460daf in main a.cc:1\nThis frame has 4 object(s):\n[96, 104) 'p'\n[160, 164) 'x' &lt;== Memory access at offset 160 is\ninside this variable\nASan report example: stack-use-after-return\nint *g;\nvoid LeakLocal() {\nint local;\ng = &amp;local;\n}\nint main() {\nLeakLocal();\nreturn *g;\n}\n% clang -g -fsanitize=address a.cc\n% ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_stack_use_after_return=1 ./a.out\n==19177==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: stack-use-after-return\nREAD of size 4 at 0x7f473d0000a0 thread T0\n#0 0x461ccf in main a.cc:8\nAddress is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 32 in frame\n#0 0x461a5f in LeakLocal() a.cc:2\nThis frame has 1 object(s):\n[32, 36) 'local' &lt;== Memory access at offset 32\nASan report example: memory leak\nint *g = new int;\nint main() {\ng = 0; // Lost the pointer.\n}\n% clang -g -fsanitize=address a.cc\n% ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1 ./a.out\n==19894==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: detected memory leaks\nDirect leak of 4 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:\n#0 0x44a3b1 in operator new(unsigned long)\n#1 0x414f66 in __cxx_global_var_init leak.cc:\ncat tests/use-after-free.c\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\nint main() {\nchar x = (char)malloc(10 * sizeof(char*));\nfree(x);\nreturn x[5];\n}\n% ../clang_build_Linux/Release+Asserts/bin/clang -fsanitize=address -O1 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g   tests/use-after-free.c\nNow, run the\nQA\nQ: Can AddressSanitizer continue running after reporting first error?\nA: Yes it can, AddressSanitizer has recently got continue-after-error mode. This is somewhat experimental so may not yet be as reliable as default setting (and not as timely supported). Also keep in mind that errors after the first one may actually be spurious. To enable continue-after-error, compile with -fsanitize-recover=address and then run your code with ASAN_OPTIONS=halt_on_error=0.\nQ: Why didn't ASan report an obviously invalid memory access in my code?\nA1: If your errors is too obvious, compiler might have already optimized it out by the time Asan runs.\nA2: Another, C-only option is accesses to global common symbols which are not protected by Asan (you can use -fno-common to disable generation of common symbols and hopefully detect more bugs).\nA3: If _FORTIFY_SOURCE is enabled, ASan may have false positives, see next question.\nQ: I've compiled my code with -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE flag and ASan, or -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE is enabled by default in my distribution (most modern distributions). Now ASan misbehaves (either produces false warnings, or does not find some bugs).\nA: Currently ASan (and other sanitizers) doesn't support source fortification, see https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/247. The fix should most likely be on the glibc side, see the (stalled) discussion here.\nQ: When I link my shared library with -fsanitize=address, it fails due to some undefined ASan symbols (e.g. asan_init_v4)?\nA: Most probably you link with -Wl,-z,defs or -Wl,--no-undefined. These flags don't work with ASan unless you also use -shared-libasan (which is the default mode for GCC, but not for Clang).\nQ: My malloc stacktraces are too short or do not make sense?\nA: Try to compile your code with -fno-omit-frame-pointer or set ASAN_OPTIONS=fast_unwind_on_malloc=0 (the latter would be a performance killer though unless you also specify malloc_context_size=2 or lower). Note that frame-pointer-based unwinding does not work on Thumb.\nQ: My new() and delete() stacktraces are too short or do not make sense?\nA: This may happen when the C++ standard library is linked statically. Prebuilt libstdc++/libc++ often do not use frame pointers, and it breaks fast (frame-pointer-based) unwinding. Either switch to the shared library with the -shared-libstdc++ flag, or use ASAN_OPTIONS=fast_unwind_on_malloc=0. The latter could be very slow.\nQ: I'm using dynamic ASan runtime and my program crashes at start with \"Shadow memory range interleaves with an existing memory mapping. ASan cannot proceed correctly.\".\nA1: If you are using shared ASan DSO, try LD_PRELOAD'ing Asan runtime into your program.\nA2: Otherwise you are probably hitting a known limitation of dynamic runtime. Libasan is initialized at the end of program startup so if some preceeding library initializer did lots of memory allocations memory region required for ASan shadow memory could be occupied by unrelated mappings.\nQ: The PC printed in ASan stack traces is consistently off by 1?\nA: This is not a bug but rather a design choice. It is hard to compute exact size of preceding instruction on CISC platforms. So ASan just decrements 1 which is enough for tools like addr2line or readelf to symbolize addresses.\nQ: I've ran with ASAN_OPTIONS=verbosity=1 and ASan tells something like\n==30654== Parsed ASAN_OPTIONS: verbosity=1\n==30654== AddressSanitizer: failed to intercept 'memcpy'\nA: This warning is false (see https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58680 for details).\nQ: I've built my main executable with ASan. Do I also need to build shared libraries?\nA: ASan will work even if you rebuild just part of your program. But you'll have to rebuild all components to detect all errors.\nQ: I've built my shared library with ASan. Can I run it with unsanitized executable?\nA: Yes! You'll need to build your library with dynamic version of ASan and then run executable with LD_PRELOAD=path/to/asan/runtime/lib.\nQ: On Linux I am seeings a crash at startup with something like this\nERROR: AddressSanitizer failed to allocate 0x400000000 (17179869184) bytes at address 67fff8000 (errno: 12)\nA: Make sure you don't have 2 in /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory\nQ: I'm working on a project that uses bare-metal OS with no pthread (TLS) support and no POSIX syscalls and want to use ASan, but its code depends on some stuff (e.g. dlsym) that is unavailable on my platform. Does ASan support bare-metal targets?\nA: Out of the box we don't have support for your use case. The easiest for you would be to rip off everything you don't have and rebuild the ASan run-time. However, there have been many attempts in applying ASan to bare-metal and at least some were successful. E.g. http://events.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/Alexander_Popov-KASan_in_a_Bare-Metal_Hypervisor_0.pdf and also grep for \"bare-metal\" and similar stuff in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/address-sanitizer group.\nQ: Can I run AddressSanitizer with more aggressive diagnostics enabled?\nA: Yes! In particular you may want to enable\nCFLAGS += -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope\nASAN_OPTIONS=strict_string_checks=1:detect_stack_use_after_return=1:check_initialization_order=1:strict_init_order=1\ncheck [Flags wiki] (https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFlags ) for more details on this.\nQ: My library crashes with SIGABRT while calling free. What's going wrong?\nA: Most probably you are dlopening your library with RTLD_DEEPBIND flag. ASan doesn't support RTLD_DEEPBIND, see issue #611 for details.\nQ: I'm getting following error when building my code: gcc: error: cannot specify -static with -fsanitize=address.\nA: ASan doesn't work with static linkage. You need to disable static linkage in order to use ASan on your code.\nQ: What do 0xbebebebebebebebe and 0xbebebebe mean?\nA: ASan, by default, writes 0xbe to newly allocated memory (see malloc_fill_byte). 0xbebebebebebebebe is (possibly) a 64-bit value that was allocated but not initialized. Similarly for 0xbebebebe.\nQ: Can I mix code instrumented by Clang with code instrumented by GCC? Or can I at least compile code with Clang and link against GCC ASan runtime and vice versa?\nA: No, you cannot, Clang and GCC have completely incompatible ASan implementations, you cannot mix them in any way.\nhttps://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerComparisonOfMemoryTools\nDBI: dynamic binary instrumentation\nCTI: compile-time instrumentation\nUMR: uninitialized memory reads\nUAF: use-after-free (aka dangling pointer)\nUAR: use-after-return\nOOB: out-of-bounds\nx86: includes 32- and 64-bit.\nmudflap was removed in GCC 4.9, as it has been superseded by AddressSanitizer.\nGuard Page: a family of memory error detectors (Electric fence or DUMA on Linux, Page Heap on Windows, libgmalloc on OS X)\ngperftools: various performance tools/error detectors bundled with TCMalloc. Heap checker (leak detector) is only available on Linux. Debug allocator provides both guard pages and canary values for more precise detection of OOB writes, so it's better than guard page-only detectors.\nMemorySanitizer (MSan) is a detector of uninitialized memory reads in C/C++ programs.\nUninitialized values occur when stack- or heap-allocated memory is read before it is written. MSan detects cases where such values affect program execution.\nMSan is bit-exact: it can track uninitialized bits in a bitfield. It will tolerate copying of uninitialized memory, and also simple logic and arithmetic operations with it. In general, MSan silently tracks the spread of uninitialized data in memory, and reports a warning when a code branch is taken (or not taken) depending on an uninitialized value.\nMSan implements a subset of functionality found in Valgrind (Memcheck tool). It is significantly faster than Memcheck (TODO:benchmark).\nGetting MemorySanitizer\nMemorySanitizer is part of LLVM trunk and has been widely available as a compile-time option in clang since version 4.0.\nAt this time, MSan supports x86_64, AArch64, PPC64, and MIPS64.\nUsing MemorySanitizer\nTo use MSan, compile and link your program with -fsanitize=memory -fPIE -pie.\nTo get any stack traces, add -fno-omit-frame-pointer.\n% cat umr.cc\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\nint* a = new int[10];\na[5] = 0;\nif (a[argc])\nprintf(\"xx\\n\");\nreturn 0;\n}\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/asan/","title":"asan"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/atomic-design-for-spas/":{"body":"This post will outline how I architect visual part of the SPAs I work on. But first, let me explain the issues I faced that led me there.\nI used to put every components in a components folder, which obviously doesn't scale and make\nit hard finding a specific component. After that, I grouped at least the top level routing\ncomponents which made things a bit tidier but was still very unsatisfying.\nLooking around for various ways to organise design elements, I found Atomic Design.\nI am not going to dive deep into explaning what is Atomatic Design as the linked article does a very good job\nso I would recommend taking 2 minutes to read it beforehand.\nYou can find a basic clone of HackerNews on GitHub: https://github.com/Keats/hn-react made using\nthe principles described in this post to illustrate this article.\nLastly, while the title doesn't mention a specific framework, all the samples will use React. The\nideas presented in this post will work equally well in Vue.js or any other component-based\nframework.\nSelf-contained components\nThat is something Vue.js users can get behind!\nEach component has now its own folder containing everything it needs to be used, apart from\nthe other components it is using as we will see in a bit.\nWhat this means is that every component folder looks very similar to something like:\n\nYou can replace tsx by js if you are not using TypeScript.\nAs you can see, the folder also contains a _style.scss. I prefer to keep my CSS out of JS and since I use Sass\nfor other projects without JavaScript, it makes sense to use it. You can use whatever floats your boat though.\nThose Sass files are only targeting specific CSS classes of that component, which solves potentially overlapping styling:\n\nThe main Sass file will import each component individual style after setting up some base rules like fonts or vertical rhythm as can be seen in\napp.scss.\nSince each component has its own folder, it is a good place to keep related code.\nFor example, if I am using GraphQL with Apollo, I will also have a queries.tsx in there with the queries\nused by the component as well as the types:\n\nNow that we have seen how I organise each individual component, let's dive in the Atomic Design part.\nAtomic Design\nIf you have read the article introducing Atomic Design, you can probably guess that your components folder is going to look like that:\n\nLet's look at them in the same order.\nAtoms\nAtoms are independent components that do not have any dependencies on other components and that exist in isolation: they\nprobably don't do anything on their own, are mostly composed of props and any action they do is coming from props.\nIn terms of Redux/MobX, all of those components should be dumb/pure/presentational components.\nLooking at one private project atoms, I have:\n\nbutton\ninput\nlink\ntag\ntoast\nportal\nicon\n\nThere are obviously many more but this should be enough to give you an idea: they are the building blocks\nof your site.\nTry to have as many of your components in that folder, you will have a much easier time composing interfaces later on.\nWhile atoms can become fairly complex (input for example), they can also be as simple as a spinner.\nMolecules\nBy themselves, atoms are not very useful and need to be combined to make something useable: input + button giving you a form for example.\nThat is what molecules are: a combination of 2 or more atoms or, in rarer cases, a smart wrapper around an atom.\nTherefore molecules should be dumb components when possible but it isn't required.\nHere are some of the molecules from the same project:\n\nform (input + label): using MobX for state but dumb otherwise\ndialog (overlay + button): dumb\ntoast-container (toast): smart component that will display the currents &lt;Toast&gt; components from the store\n\nSince the HackerNews repository is a basic example, I didn't create enough atoms to have interesting molecules. However, looking at\nthe story-item it is easy to imagine\nadding an upvote atom in there.\nIf you need to use a molecule in another molecule, it probably means it is an organism folder as we will now see.\nOrganisms\nAs with molecules, there are two types of organisms I distinguish here:\n\ncomponents using one or more molecules\nbusiness-specific usage of molecule\n\nA good definition comes from the original article:\n\nOrganisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.\n\nAs before, here are some examples in my project:\n\nsidebar: uses only one molecule but is a distinct section of the interface\nlogin-form: the form molecule set-up with the right fields and the GraphQL login query\nsignup-form: the form molecule set-up with the right fields and the GraphQL signup query\n\nEach form in the app gets its own component, making testing/storybook very easy.\nMost of those forms components do not have style of their own as they just rely on the form molecule for that.\nI do not have any organisms in the HackerNews example.\nTemplates\nIf you look at most SaaS sites, you will notice they use different layouts for different parts of their site:\nthe most common one being one logged out layout for the login/signup forms and the logged in layout\nwith your dashboard and the actual tool.\nI classify those different layouts as templates and you could have for example:\n\nlogged-in: a sidebar organism on the left and the child on the rest of the page\nlogged-out: a different background with centered forms\nsettings: some tabs\n\nEach of those templates will have their own styling - since that's their main use - but potentially also queries: you probably\nneed to fetch the current user information for a logged-in template so moving that query at the template level will allow each page using it\nto automatically fetch the data in a uniform way.\nThe HackerNews example has only one template as, even\nwhen logged in, the interface doesn't change significantly.\nPages\nThose are the components you use in your router, each of them corresponding to a specific URL.\nThey are therefore connected to your data stores and will probably have to fetch some data from your server. Most of the time,\nthese components render method will be wrapped into a template component to ensure consistent styling.\nPages tie all of the elements of Atomic Design we just talked about in a small component. There shouldn't be any styling\nin those components other than the (rare) occasional divergence.\nI also follow a slightly more lax approach to the \"one component = one folder\" mantra and group sub-routes in the same folder as the main route\nfor easy discovery.\nExample of pages components:\n\nlogin\nhome\nuser-settings\nverify-email\n\nYou can view the HackerNews homepage for an example.\nConclusion\nWhile some of the rules I introduced seem inflexible, you can bend them so they make sense to you.\nFor example, I put my overlay component in the atoms folder despite it using the portal atom simply because I kept looking for it in the atoms folder\nsince I always forget it actually uses portal.\nOverall, this structure has been a big improvement for me:\n\nsuper easy to find components (if you don't have a Go To Definition shortcut)\ntrivial to test and make storybook stories\nself contained enough that I can copy-paste the atoms and molecules folder and have everything working quickly\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, I wrote a HN clone as an example for that article.\nIt is a basic React app following Atomic Design using TypeScript and MobX, as well as the routing\nmethod I wrote about before if you are curious about how it looks in practice.\nIn my own projects, I also use StoryBook to easily have a visual overview of every component but I skipped adding it\nfor this example app.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/atomic-design-for-spas/","title":"Atomic Design in Single Page Applications"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/comparing-weathers/":{"body":"\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      month\n      avg_temp\n      min_temp\n      max_temp\n      humidity\n      rainfall\n      raindays\n      snowdays\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      0\n      01-2011\n      8.6\n      4.8\n      12.4\n      67.0\n      2.9\n      5\n      0\n    \n    \n      1\n      02-2011\n      9.3\n      7.1\n      11.1\n      69.1\n      2.9\n      5\n      0\n    \n    \n      2\n      03-2011\n      11.7\n      7.8\n      14.3\n      67.0\n      3.9\n      5\n      0\n    \n    \n      3\n      04-2011\n      15.6\n      13.3\n      18.5\n      67.4\n      0.4\n      1\n      0\n    \n    \n      4\n      05-2011\n      19.7\n      16.6\n      24.8\n      60.6\n      0.0\n      0\n      0\n    \n  \n\nWe can see the shape of our CSV files.\nThere are 8 columns, all pretty explicit and containing the average for the month in column month except for raindays and snowdays which contains the number of days in that month where it rained and snowed respectively.\nNote: I currently count raindays as the number of days where the rainfall is above 5mm (which is completely arbitrary).\nIf you look at the website I scraped it does contain a column for rain days  but some days are marked as rain days when there is no rainfall and the reverse.\nEven then it's not really accurate as I'm only interested in quality of life and rain at 4am is not annoying lots of people.\nCool.

Summer is quite nice all around, nice temperatures and pretty dry.\nNice is good all year round, it sometimes gets below 10° but never reaches 0° while being dry. Having grown up there I feel like I have been spoiled when it comes to weather.\nLondon is average but we can see the winter is very humid, which is the reason why I feel colder when it's 0° in London than -15° in Montreal.\nOkinawa looks really good until you experience that summer humidity. For those that haven't lived in a tropical climate, it means that you are sweating an awful lot very quickly and air con is a necessity.\n\nTo finish this notebook, let's have a look at the rain and snow data.\n\n\n\nWe can see it's raining quite a bit in Okinawa since they have a rainy season (May-June) and a typhoon season (June-November).\nNice is probably the nicest, having close to no rains during summer.\nWhen it comes to snow, Montreal is the only contender as snow in Nice and London is very rare and it hasn't snowed in Okinawa for over 30 years.\nWhile weather is only one of the elements that are necessary to consider when moving (along with salary, atmosphere, friends/family etc.), it is one of the most important thing for me.\nIf I had to make a ranking of those cities on a weather basis, it would be:\n\nNice\nMontreal\nOkinawa/London\n\nOkinawa and London are tied for completely different reasons: one has the legendary British weather and its 2 weeks of summer and the other is so hot and humid that it can be hard to breath at times (but you get amazing sea and beaches).\nNow that you have seen how to use Pandas (for those that had never tried it before), it's up to you to finds things to compare.

Roles are basically meant to divide a playbook in small subsets to make it more reusable and clear\n\nRoles (everything in roles/directory)\nRoles are basically directories containing known directories: tasks, files, templates, handlers and vars.\nAll the main.yml in these folders will automatically be added to the play and you won't need to specify path for files in files and templates.\nTasks (roles/*/tasks/*.yml)\nThese are the actions the play will execute\nHere's the roles/pelican/tasks/main.yml :\n\nThis uses several modules but this is really how Ansible works : give a\nname to a task and the command to execute, using a module or a raw command.\nI include the deploy.yml instead of listing the tasks in main.yml because I might want to create another playbook only for deploy and it's clearer\nthat way anyway.\nAll the {{ }} elements are variables explained in the next part.\nSince you probably don't want to run the whole play everytime you're deploying something, you can tag some tasks and run tasks by tags later.\nHere is the deploy.yml :\n\nSeveral things going on there.\nFirst you can notice that we're using sudo and sudo_user because we want to run these steps as the pelican user and not root (not very satistied\nof that solution, would probably make more sense to have a deploy role using the pelican user directly).\nAll the tasks are using the deploy tag, meaning that I will be able to run only those tasks later if I choose to.\nVariables (roles/*/vars/*.yml)\nThese values will be added into the play and usable throughout the play.\nIn this case, I'm using the variables in tasks and templates (the nginx config).\nYou can also define variable specific to a group by putting them in a group_vars folder in a top directory and naming the yml file the name of the\ngroup (or use all.yml if you want the variables to be available for every groupe).\nYou can use interpolation from within the file itself, but you need to use the ${} syntax of the {{ }} (if anyone knows how to make it work using {{ }} ).\n\nHandlers (roles/*/handlers/*yml)\nHandlers are tasks that you reference by name (you can see the notify: reload nginx in the deploy.yml).\nThey are basically used to restart/reload services.\n\nRunning it\nTo run a playbook, just specify which inventory file you want to use with -i flag and the name of the playbook file.\nIf you're logging in with a password, you will need the --ask-pass option.\nYou can also limit which tasks should be run using the tags parameter.\n\nConclusion\nHaving the whole process automated means I can get a new server and have it up and running in less than 5 minutes and that's pretty cool.\nI'm also going to put the deploy in the post-commit hook so I won't even have to run the playbook manually.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/deploying-this-blog-using-ansible/","title":"Provisioning and deploying this blog with Ansible"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/direnv/":{"body":"Following the Twelve-Factors app, most web applications\nare storing configuration in environment variables rather than in a repository. It is possible\nto store secrets securely in a repository with git-crypt but that will likely be the topic\nof another article.\nWhile in CI and on servers loading those environment variables happen automatically, loading them on your computer is problematic. The\nmost popular approach is dotenv: you store your environment variables in a .env file and a library in your project will look for\nit and load them. A .env file sample:\n\nAnd, for example in the JavaScript implementation, they can be loaded by adding require('dotenv').config() to your project, as early as possible.\nAs you can see, this adds a dependency to your project that is only used in development: in CI variables are likely to be set in the CI itself and in production\nby whatever provisioning tool you are using.\nEnter direnv.\nIt starts the same way as dotenv: you write your variables in a .envrc file which is almost identical to the example above: entries have an export keyword first. \n\nWhat sets it apart is how it loads the variables. \nYou first need to install direnv, which is a cross-platform binary available on most package managers as well as set up a hook in your bash/zsh/fish config.\nThis might sound complex but you only need to do this setup once per computer and it actually takes less than a minute. The hook is fast enough that it\nis imperceptible - no need to worry about terminal slowdown.\nNow that you have the direnv hook, if you cd to a directory with a .envrc you will see:\n\nAs mentioned in the message, direnv will not automatically load the variables found: you first need to allow the .envrc file. You will need\nto run direnv allow every time the .envrc is modified. Since direnv loads the variable automatically, this is needed for security as any\nrepo could run commands on your machine otherwise. \nAnd that's it you're done. Every time you will cd in a directory, it will automatically load variables found in .envrc and unload them when moving\nout of the directory: \n\nYou get the benefits of environment variables for configuration without having to add a dependency to your project.\nI was actually using direnv before hearing about dotenv: https://github.com/Keats/dbmigrate/pull/14 and I still don't really see myself using dotenv over it. \nI'm guessing the advantage of dotenv is if you are launching things from an IDE directly, using Docker or at companies restricting what can be installed on a machine. \nIf this is not your case, I highly recommend direnv.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/direnv/","title":"Managing environment variables with direnv"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/example-content/":{"body":"Howdy!

This is a bad idea as you need to update your fixtures everytime you modify your models\nORM: you could for example use MyModel.objects.create in Django to create your object in the database. Much cleaner than fixtures but you will repeat yourself quite a bit.\nFactories: that's what the article is about, define a template once (or not at all with Model Mommy) and you can use the factory in all your tests.\n\nYou could create your own factory system based on the ORM but there are libraries that already do that, and do it well so there's no point reinventing the wheel.\nAll the examples below will be for Django tests and we are going to make factories for the following models:\n\nFactory Boy\nis based on factory_girl for those of you that used it in Ruby.\nUsing it is very simple, define your factory by creating a class that inherits from the class you want to use (it supports several ORM, mainly Django and SQLAlchemy).\nIt brings lots of cool features like lazy attributes, fuzzy attributes,  sequences and more.\nLet's see how the factories would work for our models:\n\nNow, to use it in your tests, it's very simple:\n\nFactory boy also provides hooks if you need to modify the object or save some properties in another database.\nModel Mommy\nModel Mommy is an extremely simple way to create objects for tests in Django (and Django only).\nLook at that:\n\nAnd yes, there's nothing else to define. Model mommy will automatically fill the objects attributes with random data corresponding to the type of column in the ORM.\nYou can obviously define the attributes manually if you want, even for related objects:\n\nYou might be thinking that having random data in your tests can be a bad idea (I tend to agree) and annoying to track down bugs (it's hard to see that sdawrewaev is a first name).\nThankfully, Model Mommy provides a way to set predefined data called recipes, with several examples in the https://github.com/vandersonmota/model_mommy#recipes (link now dead).\nIt doesn't have lazy attributes though.\nWhich one should I use?\nIf you are using something other than Django, the choice is easy and you should use Factory Boy if possible.\nIf you are using Django, things are pretty much down to your personal preference as both do a good job providing models for your tests.\nI really like how simple it is to use Model Mommy and the ORM syntax to edit relationship attributes but since I don't want random data, I would always use recipes and I might as well use Factory Boy.\nIn the end I use Factory Boy, the explicit declaration and the possibility of using the same tool on a Flask or Pyramid project makes it very attractive.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/factory-boy-or-model-mommy/","title":"Python testing: Factory Boy or Model Mommy"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/generating-podcast-stats-in-php/":{"body":"In the 100th episode of Three Devs and a Maybe I decided to generate some stats relating to the previous 99 episodes and formed a small quiz out of these findings.\nAll information relating to each podcast is stored in separate Markdown files within YAML front-matter, which makes it easy to pull out and process.\nI thought it would be interesting to go over the code I used to achieve this.\n\nParsing the YAML front-matter\nThe first job we need to do is to parse each of the podcasts front-matter into a format that we can processed in PHP.\n{% highlight php %}\nformat('D');

And you would be somewhat correct!\nUsing the error_chain! macro gives me Result, ResultExt (a trait), ErrorKind and Error but I didn't define any\ncustom errors myself.\nIt's obviously not always empty though, here's the errors.rs of a static site engine using Tera:\n\nThe article linked previously made me realise that you need custom errors in 2 occasions: the user of the library will pattern match on them or you want\nto avoid repeating yourself like the InvalidConfig above.\nIn Tera case, I was able to replace all the errors with bail! macro that comes with error-chain.\nThis is a very simple macro that works similarly to println! except it returns an error with the text given:\n\nIt doesn't look like much but using stringly typed errors saves a lot of time and makes you write better errors\nat the same time as you can write very specific errors without any boilerplate.\nBut the killer feature of error-chain is to chain errors, as its name implies.\nYou often want to add context to errors and chaining allows just that.\nThe easiest example is a function to open a file: Rust doesn't include the filename in the error but you usually want it if\nyou are going to display it.\n\nchain_err is coming from the ResultExt and is where the magic happens. If an error in File::open happens,\nit will create a new error, storing the one caused by File::open as its cause. Errors can be chained multiple times, allowing you\nto annotate errors at several levels and giving detailed error messages.\nPrinting all chained errors is as simple as the code below:\n\nI'm liking this approach quite a lot and will be using it for all my projects for the foreseeable future!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/handling-errors-in-rust/","title":"Handling errors in Rust"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/happy-with-frontend-setup/":{"body":"From time to time, I see someone on Github forking or starring the Angular boilerplate I made and was using 2 years ago.\nAs everyone knows, time in JavaScript-land tends to operate in a different scale: something done 2 years ago\nis prehistoric and a generation or two of frameworks went by.\nI have been using React for about a year now, mainly for the frontend\nof Proppy and some experiments on the side. While the churn for the libraries during that year\nreached a level I had never seen before, it seems to have stabilised a bit.\nThat or I stopped trying to follow JS news, who knows.\nSince many people might suffer from analysis paralysis, I decided to document\nmy own choices to help.

neat"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/introducing-people-to-gulp/":{"body":"UPDATE (2014/07/23)\nI have updated gulp and replaced connect with browsersync (I did that already in the article with an earlier version of browser-sync but not on the example project on github, it is now up to date).\nI also do not use coffeescript anymore, I switched to typescript and use plain js for the gulpfile but everything in this post is still valid.\nUPDATE (2015/05/07)\nThis article was written for gulp 3.\nIf you want to move to gulp 4, please go this article.\nIntroduction\nSo I wanted to make changes to my ng-boilerplate project to make it simple enough for a javascript newbie to understand what was going on.\nThe main issue was the Gruntfile and its configuration, roughly 400 lines of javascript handling all the possible tasks (watch, releasse, test, etc): it was working, but was pretty hard to see what was going on.\nAlso having to put files in temporary directory all the time was bugging me.\nEnter gulp.js (an example project following the example described in this post is available here).\nGulp\nGulp uses Node.js streams (explanations here), meaning it doesn't need to create files and thus is faster than Grunt.\nAnother advantage for Gulp is that gulpfiles are actually code, not configuration like Grunt, making it very easy to understand what's going on at a glance (and shorter in my case as well).\nThe way gulp works is the following:\n\nselect the input files (for example all the .coffee files)\npass them through plugins (linting, coffeescript, concat, minify)\noutput them somewhere if needed\n\nContrary to grunt, you only define the source files once, not for every plugin.\nExample\nI am going to use a basic sass/coffeescript project setup for the example.\nThe project is organised the following way:\n\nThe goal is to have automatic compilation of sass and copy of index.html and *.coffee files to the dist folder on change, automatically reloading the page when that happens.\nFirst we need to install gulp and create a gulpfile (in coffeescript for the example).\n\nYou can run a gulp task that way:\n\nThe second command will run the task called default.\nBefore modifying the file, let's think at what we will need:\n\nsass compiler (gulp-sass)\nsomething to reload the page (browsersync)\ncoffeescript linter (gulp-coffeelint)\ncoffeescript compiler (gulp-coffee)\nconcat files (gulp-concat)\nminify js (gulp-uglify)\n\nLet's install those.\n\nNo need to load task the Grunt way, we can just require those the node way:\n\nI like to define the sources/destinations paths right at the beginning, works for me but everyone will do that differently.\n\nGulp has a very simple API and we are going to use 4 methods from it: task, src, dest and watch (that's pretty much the whole API).\nThe first task will be to set the server for the dev environment with the autoreload.\n\nThere are several plugins that reload the page but this one is the simplest I found, simply defines the files you want to watch and it will reload for you, no need for additional config.\nThis task is not a really good example of what gulp does so let's move to a more exciting one, the sass task.\n\nNow you can see a bit more of a magic but it's still fairly straightforward.\ngulp.src finds the files that matches the glob, pipe them to the sass plugin that will compile them (setting errLogToConsole to true means we won't exit gulp if we make a mistake in the sass file, good when watching), result is piped to gulp.dest which defines the destination to which we want to write the file.\nThe HTML task just copies the index.html file to the dist folder and reloads the server, you should be able to follow the code by now.\n\nNow the coffeescript task is more interesting because it really highlights the difference between Grunt and Gulp.\nWith Grunt you would need to put your files into temporary folders, for example after compiling the .coffee files.\n\nI find this system quite brilliant, no need to go through temp folders just to be able to run all your tasks and it's WAY more readable than going through the config for each of these plugins you would do in Grunt.\nThe last bit to do is the watch task, ie the one used in dev to do all these things when a file changes.\n\nAnd that's it, you got the whole thing set up (well...), very easy to understand even by someone that never used gulp.\nAny dev should be able to tell what's going on from the code itself.\nI lied a bit when I said everything was setup.\nRight now there are 2 glaring issues:\n\nno way to make a clean build\nwe don't want to have the js minified when developing\n\nLet's fix that !\nWe need to install a few additional plugins and add a few tasks:\n\n\nThis allows us to make a clean build and watch over the changes.\nFor the env/prod differences (like minifying), you need to pass another argument called type when running gulp:\n\nAnd then retrieve that value using gulp-util and use it in the tasks:\n\nYou can find an example app using this gulpfile here https://github.com/Keats/gulp-example, and see the whole gulpfile there.\nConclusion\nI really like Gulp !\nThis feels way more simple to write and to read than Grunt was.\nI got my ng-boilerplate setup to be equal to how it was with Grunt in one afternoon and it certainly feels faster.\nIf you have any comments or feedback (ie I'm doing something horribly wrong), feel free to post a comment and/or make a pull request to the example project.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/introducing-people-to-gulp/","title":"Gulp by example"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/introducing-tera/":{"body":"in Proppy to Rust: jwt, bcrypt (granted that Argon2 seems superior) and a migration tool. While I mostly do SPAs these days and don't write many templates in the backend, I still need one for some occasions. When using Python, I like Jinja2 and Django templates. Here's how I attempted to port them to Rust and the result is Tera.\nGoals and philosophy\nAs mentioned before, the inspiration comes from both Jinja2 and Django templates. As you might know, those two have similar syntax but different philosophies: Django templates are for presentation only and don't allow a lot of logic while Jinja2 has more powerful programming constructs in the templates.\nI side with Django on this one as complex logic is better put in code than in a template but Django goes a bit too far by even not supporting something like {{ count + 1 }}.\nSo here are some of the features I want:\n\nmath operations in templates\nno macros or other complex logic in the template\nbeautiful html output out of the box (ie no need for the {{- tags)\nsimple inheritance\nsimple to use filters\nable to register new tags easily like the {% url ... %} in Django\ninclude partial templates\n\nWhile new tags are definitely logic in the template, that logic would have to be written in Rust and not in a template. That limits reusability but is simpler to understand in the end.\nFilters should be kept simple and be limited in scope: variable in, modifier function with optional argument and return a string. The easiest to think of would be uppercase, lowercase, capitalize and more importantly time formatting. Here are some examples of how it should look:\n\nUsers should be able to add their own filters as well.\nIn terms of error handling, we cannot do anything if a template cannot be parsed so panicking when encountering an error is fine and template compilation should be done at rustc compile time to ensure everything works perfectly (more on that on the README.md).\nOn the API side, using Tera should be trivial:\n\ngive a glob that will load all the matching files\nregister tag/filter to Tera\nparse all templates\ncreate a context easily (not as simple as a dict obviously though)\ncall a render method that returns a Result\n\nIn code that would like that:\n\nTemplate compilation should only happen once. This can be achieved by using lazy_static.\nLet's see how it's built now!\nHow it's made\nI actually thought of making a template engine after watching the \"Lexical Scanning in Go\" video by Rob Pike (youtube link).\nLexer/Parser\nThis talk explains how the lexing in the template package in the Go standard library is implemented. I thought it was pretty cool and implemented something similar last summer.\nFor those that don't want to watch the video, here's a quick summary.\nThe lexer can be in a few states: inside a block, text, space, number, identifier, string for Tera currently and there are actions that represents what we do and result in a new state. In short, that means we have a state function that takes the lexer as an argument and returns a state function. While this is easy to do in Go, you cannot do reference the type while declaring it but it's ok to do so for a struct.\n\nThanks for the help on IRC for that one.\nThe lexer just runs the state function until we reach EOF which in our case is represented by returning None as a state function. Here's the whole run method of the lexer:\n\nThe actions read the next character and know what to do for each kind of character, eg. finding a number in a variable block will return the lex_number state function. The lexer ouput is a vector of tokens that ends with either a EOF or an error.\nYou can read the whole lexer on GitHub, it is actually quite simple and readable.\nThe parser is quite simple as well. Since we are either in text, in a variable block or in a tag block, we just handle those cases in a loop and use EOF to break. Each \"state\" knows how to parse itself so the main logic is actually only:\n\nThe trickiest bit was handling precedence in blocks so that something like {{1 / 2 + 3 * 2 + 42}} would parse as expected. This is done by assigning precedence values to each kind of token and looking forward to see if something with higer precedence is coming. I would be surprised if there was not a bug in there.\nThe output of the parser is a classic AST.\nContext\nContext is where dynamic languages have the upper hand. In python I can just pass a dict {\"user\": user, \"count\": 1} to Jinja2 or Django and be done with it. In Rust, it can't be that easy unfortunately.\nHere's the same context as above for Tera:\n\nTo make that possible, Tera uses serde which means that in the example above, the user variable would have to implement the Serialize trait. This makes Tera annoying to use on non-nightly Rust as compiler plugins are not stable yet. Serde is the future for serialization in Rust so might as well embrace it.\nRendering\nIn the rendering phase, we take the AST from the parser and traverse it, replacing variables with values from the context and handling the various tag blocks. It is also home to some terrible terrible code, namely the eval_condition method that checks if and elif conditions. It has a cyclomatic complexity of 27 apparently.\nIt also contains the classic test fixing snippet that will be removed after I handle calculations properly:\n\nFeedback on the dev aspect\nThe more Rust I do, the more I like it. There are times where you might look at the screen blankly for a few minutes and then decide to have a walk instead but it happens less and less. IRC and the Rust subreddit are very good source for help if you are stuck and they have interesting conversations.\nWith no hesitation, Clippy is the MVP of the development tools I'm using at the moment across all languages (Rust, Python and TypeScript mostly). It is a linter that catches lots of errors or bad code and shows you how to fix or how to do what you wanted to do but in a clearer way. The team is adding lints continuously so I usually just cargo update my projects every week or so just so I can run the latest clippy on it.\nError messages are usually very good and are getting even better soon.\nWhat's next\nThe main things Tera are missing right now are filters and a way to add custom tag blocks. If anyone thinks that it is 2016 and therefore should use a parser combinator, feel free to submit a PR! I also welcome any feedback on Tera design as it doesn't have to be a clone of Jinja2 or Django.\nSince I am quite busy with our first product Proppy, I won't have a huge amount of time so any help is welcome.\nTo finish on a \"Rust for web\" note, the last main thing I would miss to try it for real is a validation crate that would work like this gist. We use marshmallow in proppy and it makes validation API data a breeze. Unfortunately, with compiler plugins being still unstable, I don't think I will start working on that. There is a RFC for stabilization though: Procedural macros.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/introducing-tera/","title":"Introducing Tera, a template engine in Rust"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/introduction/":{"body":"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde.

I've changed the URLs so they don't 404\n\nLast week my article Using Protobuf instead of JSON to communicate with a frontend ended up being number one on Hacker News and we saw a crazy amount of traffic coming on this blog.\nI thought that it would be interesting to analyze some of that data so here it is.\nThe data\nIt is coming from Google Analytics and while I could just paste screenshots, that wouldn't be any fun so I exported some of it as CSVs and used them in the notebook you can see below. The data is over the past month to have more insights on various social \"strategies\" (or rather, lack of) as you will see in a bit.\n\n\n\n\nHere are the links of the articles for reference (I'll refer to them by their number in the list below from now on):\n\nBerg's Little Printer (not live anymore)\nComparing the weather of places I've lived in\nMy experience of using NixOps as an Ansible user (not live anymore)\nUsing Protobuf instead of JSON to communicate with a frontend\n\nWe always tweet when we post an article but only post to HN/Reddit the ones we feel are interesting enough. Article 1 has not been posted anywhere, number 2 has been posted on r/python and number 3 and 4 were both on the front page of HackerNews, with number 4 being at the top for some time.\nFrom that graph and my experience with my previous blog, HN brings way more readers than reddit or twitter.\nLet's have a look to see if I'm right.\n\n\n\nWe can see most of our sessions are coming from Social, which includes HN/Reddit/Twitter mainly: 16,946 to be exact.\nWe also have a significant portion of users coming from referrals which are mainly Python newsletters, feedly.com, lobste.rs, hckrnews.com and flipboard.com.\nLet's drill down into those social sessions to see where they are coming from but since I am lazy (and we don't want a pie chart overdose!) I will just paste the number of sessions from each rather having a pie chart for that:\n\nHacker News: 15,223 (89.83%)\nTwitter: 1,008 (5.95%)\nReddit: 323 (1.91%)\nFacebook: 247 (1.46%)\nOther: 144 (0.85%)\n\nI was a bit surprised by the Twitter amount so I went and found that there is a HN bot with lots of followers that tweets the articles. I guess most of them come from that tweet since we are not really active on Twitter ourselves.\nThis is cool but I am more interested on what location/devices the people are using so let's have a look.\n\n\n\nAs expected, most of the users are from English speaking countries, the articles being written in English after all. We could translate them into French/German if we wanted but that wouldn't be worth the effort of maintaining multiple versions of each article.\nIn terms of cities, the top 3 are San Francisco, New York and London. Again nothing surprising.  The first non english-speaking city is Berlin at the 8th position but Paris is only 4 sessions away from overtaking Los Angeles and taking the 10th position.\nTo me, having people in thousands of cities in over 100 countries reading what we write is pretty mind-blowing and is by far the best part.\nI couldn't finish that notebook without satisfying some of my curiosity: what devices/OS/browsers are used?\nFirst, what devices are readers mostly using?\n\ndesktop: 16,211 (64.94%)\nmobile: 7,335 (29.38%)\ntablet: 1,418 (5.68%)\n\nNothing surprising here either, most people browse websites from a computer. In the mobile/tablet category, iPhone and iPad are the big winners in terms of number of users but Android still wins due to the sheer number of devices as we will see below.\nIf anyone is working on a B2B app, would you be able to share those numbers? It seems to me that you could forego responsiveness for quite a lot of B2B products, or only have a basic one.\n\n\n\nInterestingly enough, Android and iOS are almost identical.\nI have to say I'm a bit surprised by the predominance of Macs, I was expecting it to be at around 25% and have more Linux users than that.\nFor Windows and Mac, it seems the readers are using majoritarily the last 2 versions of each OS, with 7 being the most used version for Window and 10.10 for Mac.\nA special hello for the person that came from Windows Server 2003 and the few still on Vista.\nLet's see what browsers everyone is using now.\n\n\n\nThis is a pretty damn big win for Chrome here and almost all of those are on Chrome 42 or 43.\nMost Safari and Firefox users are also on the latest version of their respective browsers.\nAbout 200 sessions came from IE and they were mostly using IE10 or IE11 so if you are a frontend person and you are targeting the HN crowd, you don't have to worry about old browsers really (but I think you already knew that).\nLooking at the list below those major players is interesting though, you find out about things like Amazon Silk or YaBrowser.\nThe server\nJust a quick word to praise static sites: we ran 15 QPS excluding static assets (50 QPS including those) on a micro instance at 0.0 load with 500 concurrent users.\nWe use Pelican but any of the dozens of other similar tools is fine and you can handle ridiculous amount of traffic without any worries. You can also host the blog on S3 or a CDN if you don't want to have a server at all.\nUsing a static site generator also makes it easy to review and improve articles, like you would do for code reviews. The only pain point is commenting on notebooks, as it is not possible to do so on the rendered version on Github and a raw notebook looks like that.\nYou can check our blog repo and look at the issues if you are curious about that process.\nNow, onto vacations!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/looking-at-hackernews-effect/","title":"The Hacker News effect examined"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/looking-at-payments-in-europe/":{"body":"As we are working on our product (if you work in an agency, we'd love to have a chat with you! send us a mail at team AT wearewizards.io), I was curious to see the payments landscape in Europe, having read so much about #VATMESS.\nIn Europe, before 2015, the supplier would charge the VAT rate of their own country to their customers: for example if the supplier was based in the UK and the customer in France, the supplier would charge the UK VAT rate.\nSince 2015 however, the supplier now has to charge the VAT rate of the customer's country and report sales to that country. This change was made to prevent unfair competition from countries with a lower VAT rate, with big companies moving to Luxembourg for example. Regulators only forgot to set a lower limit (they are apparently now thinking of a £5k limit) and didn't think of SME or thought about it and decided that crippling European businesses would be a good idea.\nNote that this change only applies to B2C customers.\nThis article will focus on what it means for a UK-based VAT-registered company as it is our case.\nBusiness side\nIf the customer is a business and is VAT registered, just getting the VAT number and checking it should be enough. However, companies paying without giving their VAT number or non-VAT registered ones should be treated as B2C.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, we need to charge the VAT of the customer's country which means we need to locate them.\nHere are some examples of pieces of informations we can use to identify a customer's location:\n\nbilling address\nIP address geolocation\nbank location\ncard location\n\nNote that the legislation requires to have two non-conflicting items of information and keep them for 10 (!) years.\nWithout the non-conflicting information you have to reject the transaction. You could possibly ask for the user to send some proof by mail but that's a terrible user experience.\nIf we manage to get customers to pay us, we then need to separate sales by country and apply the right VAT. This gives us the amount of tax we need to pay for each country.\nThe UK has put in place something called the VAT Mini One Stop Shop or VAT MOSS (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-and-use-the-vat-mini-one-stop-shop). This allows businesses to register in only one country and let it redistribute the money after filing a VAT return for other countries on a quarterly basis with the amounts we calculated.\nImplementing\nNow that we have an overview of what the VAT system looks like, let's have a look at the solutions.\nPayment providers\nNone of these (except FastSpring) actually help with the VAT mess but are still needed.\nThere are a few alternatives here:\n\nStripe\nBraintree\nPaymill\nFastSpring\n\nPaymill is based in Europe. Stripe is extremely easy to setup and get started. I haven't used the other two so I can't comment on those but it seems you need to be approved for a merchant account for them which means some some wait.\nHere are the advertised rates (you might get a better one by talking with them):\n\nPaymill: 2.95% + 0.28€\nBraintree: 2.4% + 20p (first £30k free) for EU cards, 3.4% + 20p for non EU cards\nStripe: 1.9% + 20p for UK cards and 2.9% + 20p for foreign cards\nFastSpring: 5.9% + $.95 per transaction\n\nLet's use a small example to see the difference: £10k sales with £5k from the UK, £3k from NA and £2k from Europe with let's say 100 transactions:\n\nStripe seems to give the best price but keep in mind you cand probably get better rates than the advertised one (at least for Paymill according to the employee I met ages ago).\nFastSpring is pretty damn expensive but seems to have European VAT handling built-in.\nHandling VAT\nImplementing it yourself\nIn all cases, you need to ask for the customer's country in the checkout form to serve as an equivalent of a billing address. You can prefill that by using the IP address for better UX.\nYou need to handle two cases:\n\nCustomer provides a VAT number\n\nCheck that the VAT number is correct and match the country given.\nIf it is valid, you only need to add VAT if the customer is based in the same country as you.\nIf the customer is not in the same country, do not charge any VAT.\n\nCustomer doesn't provide VAT number\n\nCompare the country selected with the IP location.\nIf it matches continue otherwise compare the country filled with the bank country.\nIf it matches continue otherwise ask the customer to send a fax with their certificate of birth and a passport.\nMore seriously: what should be done in the last case?\nThere are APIs to get up-to-date VAT rates and check VAT numbers but you could use pyvat for example to handle all of that for you. Keep in mind that you do not charge VAT for clients outside of the EU.\nWhile this is annoying, it doesn't seem like a huge amount of work.\nUsing a third party\nIf you prefer using off-the-shelf solutions, a few exist that handle the VAT aspect (note that I haven't used any of them):\n\nRecurly: $99/month and 10¢ per transaction + 1.25% of revenue (on top of payment gateway)\nQuaderno: $29/month on top of your payment provider, provides a widget for checkout that handles European VAT rules\nTaxamo: £40/month for all the regions, pretty limited number of country as it's missing Canada and Australia for example. Doesn't actually show what the product is but included for completeness\nChargebee: $49/month on top of a payment provider\n\nOut of those, Quaderno seems to be the best choice and is fairly cheap. Recurly looks neat as well but is quite expensive without a clear added value on what it adds to let's say Stripe recurrent billing.\nConclusion\nAs a developer I am tempted to write my own version but Quaderno seems like a good fit and is cheap enough for a B2B SaaS that it might be worth avoiding the hassle of coding it.\nWe are more interested in feedback really, quite curious of how European SaaS are handling payments after this year's change in VAT.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/looking-at-payments-in-europe/","title":"Looking at payments solution for SaaS in Europe"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/looking-at-where-to-incorporate/":{"body":"We are very lucky as EU citizens to have access to 28 (well, soon 27 apparently) countries.\nTo give a bit of context to this blog post, We Are Wizards is currently a company based in the UK, founded by 2 French and one German, all living in London at the moment.\nWhile this post tries to be general, it is guided by our own requirements. There might be inaccuracies in this article so don't take my word for it and contact companies/government in the countries before making a decision if you decide to do so. We've added the tax rates so you can get a feel of the different options but they are not a deciding factor for us.\nOur requirements\nAs mentioned in the introduction, we are French and German and the only common language is English so being able to do all (or at least the vast majority) government/bank interactions in English is a hard requirement.\nWe also need to be able to incorporate in a country without living there since we don't want to move or, in my case, want to travel. This is especially true if you are planning to be a digital nomad.\nLastly, we want a business-friendly country with a good record on privacy and surveillance law as we run Passopolis, an open-source password manager that relies on end-to-end encryption.\nTo sum it up, our requirements are:\n\nwe need to be able to do things in English\nwe need to be able to incorporate without living there\nwe want its government to be privacy friendly and not authoritarian\n\nCountries selection\nWith the rejected countries out of the way, let's go over the potential choices I have identified after a bit of research.\nTo keep the each country information DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), one advice common to every country including your own is to get an accountant from the start as they are not that expensive in the grand scheme of things and they make everything easier.\nDo note that you can Google \"company formation country_X\" and you will get lots of companies offering services helping you with incorporation and taxes.\nUnited Kingdom\nTrivia\nThe UK is very business friendly and the biggest tech centre in Europe. You can probably go to a tech meetup every day if you wanted to and you get to meet and work with people from all over the world.\nIn terms of privacy laws, the UK is not doing too great with the IP Bill it's trying to pass.\nThe obvious elephant in the room is Brexit. No one really knows when it will actually happen and what will be the outcome so there is a great deal of uncertainty about, well, everything.\nThe biggest uncertainty for us is our residency status as we are not UK citizens and there is a greater than zero risk that we would not be able to stay. Getting citizenship is not an option for me for example as I'm moving out of the country soon.\nSadly enough, EU VAT handling could become even harder than the current VAT MOSS for UK businesses.\nThe UK is currently the place to be in Europe if you want to get investment but it might change after Brexit.\nTaxes\nThe corporation tax is currently 20% but there are talks to reduce it to 17% by 2020 and potentially even further.\nDividend tax depends on your total income and can vary quite a bit.\nHow to incorporate/open bank account\nIncorporating is very simple and usually only takes a day or so. Most accountants will offer incorporation as a freebie.\nYou can open a bank account remotely and most banks in the UK (at least the one I've seen) offer a good online banking experience.\nWith an accountant and a tool like FreeAgent or Xero, you don't really need to do any significant business administration work. We haven't run into issues with HMRC (the revenue service in the UK) that you are dealing with as a company but I have heard many horror stories about it.\nVirtual offices are easy to find in London so you don't have to live in the country.\nIreland\nTrivia\nThe other obvious choice when it comes to English speaking countries in the EU. It is also famous for being the main place for big companies to do tax avoidance with a special arrangement called the Double Irish arrangement.\nIreland is very business friendly, doesn't seem to want to ban encryption any time soon and its culture is similar to the one in the UK.\nUnfortunately, politics there seem partially driven by religion and they have actually introduced a blasphemy law in 2009, which seems hard to believe.\nTaxes\nThe corporation tax is 12.5% and it might get interesting if the UK and Ireland get into a lower corporation tax war. The dividend tax rate is a flat 20%.\nThere is also a tax exemption for the first three years if the company's corporation tax to pay does not exceed €40,000, which corresponds to €320,000 of profit at the 12.5% tax rate. In short, unless you're growing super fast in terms of profit, you're not paying any corporation tax for the first three years.\nHow to incorporate/open bank account\nIncorporating in Ireland takes 2-3 days and cost €320 euros. Opening a bank account might be possible remotely but it might be easier to do a day trip to Dublin.\nVirtual offices are easy to find in Dublin so you don't have to live in the country.\nEstonia\nTrivia\nI'll be the first one to say I don't know much about Estonia. According to Enterprise Estonia, most of the interactions with the government and banks can be done in English. Having a local partner is useful for the more complex cases where it might be needed and, since you should get a local accountant, this shouldn't be an issue.\nThe political environment seems pretty quiet and the current leading political party, the Estonia Reform Party is advocating for even more liberalism when it comes to companies.\nEstonia ranks 1st on the Barclays Digital Development index and 16th on the Doing Business ranking\nDo note that Stripe is not available in Estonia yet so it might be a deal breaker if your business depends on it, which might be our case depending on what payment provider we choose for Proppy(article on that coming soon). There is no timeline for it as well:\n@WeAreWizardsIO No timeline as of yet, sorry! Feel free to sign up here and we'll notify you as soon as we're ready https://t.co/vbuzSSxceJ— Stripe (@stripe) 25 July 2016\n\nTaxes\nEstonia has a very competitive tax system. The corporation tax is 0% as long as the money stays into the company bank account. Once you take dividends, those are taxed at a flat 20% rate.\nHow to incorporate/open bank account\nEstonia is at the forefront of e-residency.\nIt can take a while to get your e-residency card and you need to pick it up yourself, which might mean a trip to Estonia if there isn't an Estonian embassy around you.\nIncorporation can be done online and takes about a day.\nHowever, you currently need to go to Estonia to open a bank account but starting September it will apparently be possible to open one through Skype.\nLeapin is recommended by the e-residency website and offers incorporation and accounting for less than 100€ per month. They prefer single shareholder but can make exceptions for multiple ones, provided that all of them have e-residency.\nSingapore\nTrivia\nFamous for its ban on chewing-gum and death penalty, this city state is the only country on that list that isn't in the EU.\nIt takes the 1st place on the Doing Business ranking and, more sadly, the 154th position on the World Press Freedom index. It also probably tops the ranking of mall per inhabitant from my own experience as a tourist there.\nThe immigration process seems pretty open and you should be able to relocate to Singapore without too many issues should you want to do that. I liked Singapore as a tourist but I couldn't say whether it would be a nice place to live or not.\nSince Singapore isn't in the EU, you also don't have to deal with EU things like VAT MOSS since the EU doesn't have jurisdiction over Singapore. Obviously, I'm not a lawyer so don't take my word for it.\nSingapore is not doing great on privacy though (see report from Privacy International) so we wouldn't be able to move there with Passopolis. I'm leaving this section there though since it could be ok for lots of companies.\nTaxes\nThe Corporation tax rate depends on the income but has a ceiling of 17%. In practice though, the rate is very low for 'small' income, aka most startups/companies:\nIncome (SGD)Effective tax rate\n100,0000%\n200,0002.15%\n300,0002.83%\n400,0004.25%\n\nI'm not going to put all the different tax rates, but even at 10,000,000 SGD is only 16.46%. 1SGD is €0.67 for reference at the time of writing.\nDividends are tax free.\nThis is pretty much a tax haven.\nHow to incorporate/open bank account\nIncorporation is possible remotely but you have to be there in person to create a bank account.\nI have looked at Rivkin which offers different packages for incorporations, some including a visa.\nThe whole package (incorporation + registered office address +  virtual office) is about 6000 SGD, roughly £3360 per year.\nAs mentioned before, you can also relocate yourself to Singapore if you fancy mango lassi and green space.\nConclusion\nA few possible choices are available! I would personally remove the UK from the list unless you have the UK citizenship.\nThat leaves us with Ireland, Estonia, Singapore and, potentially, your own country. The choice is then up to you and your preferences.\nWe Are Wizards might move to one of these countries because of Brexit and the IP Bill and therefore would like to hear stories from companies/startups based in those.\nLet us know by email (team AT wearewizards.io) or comment and we can add it to the article!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/looking-at-where-to-incorporate/","title":"Where to incorporate if you are a EU citizen"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/making-a-django-rest-framework-template/":{"body":"I made a project template for Django 1.7 + Django REST framework + PostgreSQL containing things I use and find useful.\nPart of it is based on Two Scoops of Django template.\nYou can see the repo on Github.\nFeatures\nIt contains the following things:\n\nDjango REST framework: for writing your API\ndjango-model-utils: for things like TimestampedModel and other nice things for models\ndjango-cors-headers: automatically allows CORS on local dev and allows for a whitelist in production\nbcrypt: hash password with bcrypt instead of PBKDF2\n\nThere are also goodies on dev and test environments:\n\ndjango-debug-toolbar: lots of information on request/response and queries\nipdb: pdb in ipython.

You can sniff the style and apply them but designing becomes tricky.\nCORS\nCORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) is an official spec designed to do exactly that (this article) explains it well).\nIf you don't need to support older browsers (IE8 and IE9 have some issues), CORS should be the way to go.\nThis will require the server to set appropriate headers to responses from the widgets.\nHidden iframes\nThis method will not use iframes directly.\nInstead, as its name suggest, a hidden iframe will be created and will be used to transmit and receive data from the provider.\nThe widgets itself will be inserted in the page HTML normally.\nThis is the approach I used since it works on every browsers.\nSo now that you have decied on how to communicate between consumer and provider, let's focus on the consumer part.\nConsumer side\nThe consumer will probably embed your widgets to add a feature to their website (social buttons, stats, ...) but they are most of the time\nnot the main part of a page.\nIt's critical that your widget doesn't slow down the consumer website or cause errors.\nFor the speed part, you need to load your script asynchronously otherwise you could block the rendering of the page.\nP4W (Playfire 4 Web, name of the Playfire widgets) uses this to load:\n\nThis assumes that the page has a &lt;head&amp; or &lt;body&amp; tag. A better way would be to find the first &lt;script&amp; (since we have at least one for sure) and insert the new script tag before it.\nIn this case embed.js is just a very small file that will load the real javascript file.\nKeeping it simple here means that you can change whatever you want behind the scene, it will still works for the people using the above snippet in their website.\nProvider side\nNothing particular needs to be done on the server since we are not using CORS.\nIf you are, don't forget to set the Allowed- headers.\nNotes about logging in\nIf your widget needs to allow people to log in, you will need to use a popup on your domain, since you won't be able to set the cookies from an another domain, more on that later.\nThe practice\nMost of the P4W widgets are doing the same thing: get data from Playfire, display them and modify it if you're logged in (there are some read-only widgets though).\nCreating some kind of frameworks thus made sense.\nChoosing the tools\nSince your javascript will be loaded on external websites, your impact on the page needs to be as small as possible so you can't just add jQuery or any library you want.\nAfter looking around, I settled on these libraries:\n\nqwery for the css selector\nbonzo for the dom manipulation\nbean for the events\neasyXDM for the cross origin messaging\nbrowserify to create bundles and use require like in node.js\nHandlebars for the templates\n\nThese 6 libraries are the core of P4W.\nIf I started now, I might have chosen Minified to replace qwery, bonzo and bean.\nThe build is using Grunt and we use Sass for the style.\nWe currently only have integration tests using CasperJS.\nCreating a framework\nSince all of those widgets have a similar pattern, creating some kind of framework makes sense.\nIt is organised the following way:\n\nAll of these files will be linted and concatenated by the Grunt task to form the lib.js loaded by the embed.js mentionned in the snippet above.\nThe main.js is the entry point of the framework: it requires all the other javascripts files and use qwery to detect whether the page it's loaded in contains\nHTML elements having classes corresponding to widgets and will initialise them.\nThis will also detect whether one of those widgets needs to know if a user is logged in or not in Playfire (for example the blog comment will need to) and do that call to\nPlayfire while the widgets are initialising.\nWidgets will then do calls for their own data and display themself.\nIf the user is not logged and an action like a click on the Want button requires the logged in state, a login popup will open, with its URL on the playfire domain so it can properly set the cookie as mentionned above.\nThe tricky part of that bit is actually closing the popup once the use logged in.\nWith most browsers, you can use postMessage to pass the data back to the opener page but this doesn't work with IE.\nThe easy (not so good) solution is to poll the server for login status once the popup has been opened for a while and close it on success response or timeout.\nThe widgets themselves all have a similar structure, allowing for copy/paste of it and then filling in the blank.\nUsing a common class for that would probably be better but some widgets (thinking of the comments one) can be quite different from others.\nTesting\nTesting third-party widgets is a bit of a pain.\nSince most of the logic will be in the server and it can be unit tested properly, I mainly focused on testing integration on the javascript side.\nThis means tests are not that fast (around 5s for one) but if the tests pass, there's no reason why the widgets wouldn't work on live.\nCasperJS was a very nice interface for PhantomJS and is quite fun to use.\nThings to watch out for\nWhile this hasn't happened to us yet since the widgets are mainly on pages we control, you have to be careful with the javascript/css you're using.\nJavascript\nRemember, this file will be executed on a third-party website and you don't control what they are doing with their javascript.\nThey could have redefined undefined or added functions to every prototypes for all you know so you can't make any assumption about what's present or not so you need to develop with that in mind.\nYou also need to make sure you're not leaking global variables of adding to prototypes yourself, which would mess up their own javascript.\nCSS\nAgain, you don't need what kind of crazy design they might have and you don't want your css to be applied to the whole website either.\nThe solution for that is to use highly specific CSS selectors and use defensive css.\nBy defensive css I mean the css to ensure your widgets renders how it should. If your widget is a small box like the Tweet button, you can't exactly have a text of font size 10em there.\nAdding css rules to ensure minimal consistency is the key here. While you are not going to set the font type or color, you can definitely force the font-size for example.\nConclusion\nWhile there's not a lot of code to show since it's not open source, I hope this article gave a good overview on how to approach the development of third party widget.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/making-third-party-widgets/","title":"Making third party widgets"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/manage-project-alternate-files/":{"body":"{{ page.date }}\n起因和目的\n起初，在管理 SpaceVim 这一项目时，每编辑一个模块源文件，总是需要关注以下几件事：\n\n相关的文档是否存在，是否需要修改，在工程内存在中英文版本的文档，是否内容保持一致。\n测试文件是否存在，是否需要修改。\n\n出于以上两点的考虑，衍生出如下需求：\n\n在编辑源文件时，迅速跳转至文档所在的源文件；\n在编辑中文文档时，迅速跳转至英文文档，反之亦然；\n在编辑源文件时，迅速跳转至测试文件，反之亦然；\n\n目前，SpaceVim 内置的这一插件基本实现了以上功能，以便于快速在相关文件之间进行跳转。\n基本的使用\nSpaceVim 提供了一个内置的工程文件跳转插件，默认的命令为 :A，\n该命令可接收参数，指定跳转类别：\n\n在使用这一特性之前，需要在工程根目录添加配置文件 .project_alt.json。例如：\n\n加入以上配置文件后，当编辑 autoload/SpaceVim/layers/lang/java.vim 文件时，\n可以通过 :A doc 跳转至 docs/layers/lang/java.md 文件。\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/manage-project-alternate-files/","title":"自定义工程文件跳转"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/markdown/":{"body":"Code Block\n\nQuote\n\nTwo things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.\n\n\nAlbert Einstein\n\nCode tags\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. \nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/markdown/","title":"Markdown Test"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/math-symbols-test/":{"body":"Inline Math\n\n$(a+b)^2$ = $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$\nA polynomial P of degree d over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is an expression of the form\n$P(s) = a_0 + a_1 . s + a_2 . s^2 + ... + a_d . s^d$ for some\n$a_0,..,a_d \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$\n\nDisplayed Math\n$$\np := (\\sum_{k∈I}{c_k.v_k} + \\delta_v.t(x))·(\\sum_{k∈I}{c_k.w_k} + \\delta_w.t(x)) − (\\sum_{k∈I}{c_k.y_k} + \\delta_y.t(x))\n$$\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/math-symbols-test/","title":"Math Symbol Support Test"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/migrating-to-gulp4/":{"body":"Last year I wrote a blog post on my personal website (you can see it here Gulp by example ) showing what gulp was and making a demo project using it.\nSince then, the team behind it did a lot of work on v4 of gulp which, while not released as of the writing of the post, is stable enough to be used.\nRather than going through a list of new features, let's update my angular boilerplate to use gulp4.\nYou can have a look at the Goal section of the README to know what this boilerplate does but for those not wanting to open the link: Typescript, Sass, automatic DI, template preloading, testing with Karma and Protractor, live reload with browser-sync.\n\nNote: I'm not using this boilerplate personally anymore since I don't really do vanilla angular anymore.\n\nHere's the starting commit.\nUpdating dependencies\nNothing fancy here, just updating our npm and bower dependencies, including pointing to the gulp4 branch on github. To use npm install from a github repo, you can use:\n\nThe boilerplate demo tests are going to fail at that point because of changes in the api of gulp and probably some in other libraries we just updated as well.\nYou can see the commit here.\nMigrating the gulpfile\nCalling gulp\nThe first thing we need to do is ensure that we are using the right version of gulp.  You might have another version installed globally or nothing installed globally like me.\nThe easiest way (at least to me) to deal with that issue is the npm scripts part of the package.json.\n\nThe downside is that you will get npm errors instead of the regular ones but that's only an issue when building your gulpfile.\nLet's not forget to update the travis.yml to use that npm script too.\nYou can see the commit here.\nFixing the errors we're getting\nIf you run the gulpfile locally or look at the travis build, you will notice we get the following error:\n\nThis comes from the fact that gulp.task changed and the 3 parameters signature was removed.\nIn short, tasks that look like the one below will need to be changed to remove the [] parameter:\n\nTo give a quick background to people not familiar with gulp, the list parameter is a list of tasks that need to be run before running that task.\nIn this case it will call the build task before running watch and karma-watch in order (runSequence is another thing that can be changed but we will get back to that later).\nTo solve that very common issue of task dependencies, two methods were added:\n\ngulp.series: will run the tasks in order\ngulp.parallel: will run the tasks in parallel\n\nLet's fix our error by replacing those dependent tasks, for example for the default task:\n\nIn that case we first want to run build, and then browser-sync, watch and karma-watch in parallel.\nIf you look at the commit below, you will be able to spot an easy mistake: browser-sync is in the gulp.series despite being blocking. In short, don't put blocking tasks in a series.\nNow trying to run the build task, I get another error:\n\nSince gulp 4 has a method to run things sequentially, let's use it.\n\n\nNote: I had to modify some tasks like the browser-sync since its API changed.\nI also had to make a patch to gulp-sass to update the node-sass version.\n\nYou can see the commit here.\nLooking at the build, it still fails because of a missing selenium jar which means a protractor error.\nMy elegant solution was the following, as in removing protractor from travis because I'm not using it right now anyway.\nSmall cleanup\nThe following is not strictly related to gulp4 but contains some of the things I like to do to have a clean gulpfile.\nThe config part at the top of the gulpfile (where I am defining all the paths to inject) is quite ugly but I am not going to touch it here, only change the gulp related things.\nFirst thing, gulp-load-plugins makes things quite simple but the prefix I had chosen, 'plugins', is quite verbose and takes up space. Recently I've started using $ which works quite well.\nSomething that took me way too long to realise is that it auto-camelCases packages names with dash so my following line was useless:\n\nAnother thing to examine is whether some of the gulp plugins you're using actually bring any values compared to using the actual npm module directly.\nIn my boilerplate, gulp-karma is not doing anything special and was only necessary while the karma team was fixing some of the issues the plugin was solving.\nWhile going through the file, I also realised I didn't test the watch process at all and that it didn't work (surprising eh).\nThe fix was easy and I included it in the clean up commit.\nLastly, I have seen quite a few people dividing their tasks in individual files but that seems like an excessive measure to me.\nMaybe it makes more sense if you have very long files but all of mine are between 50 and 200 lines (this one is actually my longest) so I never felt the need.\nWrap up\nSome functions from gulp 3 such a gulp.start and gulp.run were deprecated and are not covered in this article since I never used them in any of my gulpfiles.\nThere is also a bunch of new functions that I haven't used yet. To have a complete overview of what's new, you can check the gulp 4 changelog.\nGulp 4 is still in alpha so I'll update this article if any breaking change happens.\nA question often asked is why use gulp when you have things like webpack around but that's out of scope for this article but will probably be part of another one.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/migrating-to-gulp4/","title":"Migrating to gulp 4"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/options/":{"body":"With Poole as a baseline theme for Jekyll, there aren't many options available out of the box.

I do not maintain any Python library so I am\nnot able to give insights on that side of the package management story.\nI will begin by quickly explaining the most common way of setting up Python projects and handling dependencies\nto make sure everyone is on the same page.\nA basic setup\nPretty much all the Django/Flask projects I have seen use the same structure: a requirements\nfolder containing several .txt files listing the dependencies and their versions.\nThe folder typically looks like the following:\n\nbase.txt contains all the essential dependencies:\n\nWhile it is not required, every requirement files I have seen were using ==, also called requirement pinning, to\ndepend on the exact versions to ensure reproducibility. Well, as much reproducibility\nas a mutable package index allows anyway as we will see later.\nOther requirements files will import the base.txt file and then add environment specific dependencies such\nas testing libraries or developer tools for local.txt for example.\n\nBut wait! Before being able to install the dependencies, you first need to create\na virtual environment if you are not using Docker. Python 3\nhas built-in support for virtualenvs and you can create one simply by running python3 -m venv tutorial-env.\nTo activate it, you need to execute the activate script in the bin folder of the virtualenv.\nAs this feature is somewhat recent, many virtualenv helpers exist to make it easier to use.\nI use virtualenvwrapper combined with the zsh plugin with\nthe same name to automatically activate the right virtualenv when I'm cding into a folder that has one.\nNow that your virtualenv is setup and activated, you can run pip install -r requirements/local.txt\nto install your dependencies.\nYou can list the currently installed packages by running pip freeze in the virtualenv. The downside is that it will also show\nall indirect dependencies as well. You can order that list with the -r my_file.txt argument to have your explicit dependencies\nat the top but it isn't great.\nThis process works but is quite manual:\n\nbeginners might not know of virtualenvs and how to use them\npackages and their versions are edited manually so it is easy to make mistakes\nby forgetting to add/remove one\nnot really secure: the package index Pypi is mutable so 2.1.0 one day\ncan be different from 2.1.0 another day and there will no way to know about it. While you can add\nhashes to requirements files but I have never seen anyone go through the hassle of doing that themselves\n\nWe can see that when dealing with package management in Python there are two issues: dealing with virtualenvs\nand actually managing the packages.\nThere are plenty of tools that have been built to fix one or both issues; let's look at a few of them now.\nI will use the list of packages of an actual Django project with about 28 dependencies to test them. While\nspeed is not THAT important for a package manager, I will only mention it if there is something to be said about it.\npip-tools\npip-tools only tries to handle the package management part, meaning you still need to use\nvirtualenvwrapper or something similar to handle virtualenvs.\npip-tools gives you two command line tools: pip-compile and pip-sync.\nThe easiest way to get started with pip-tools is to create a requirements.in file listing your dependencies:\n\nThe requirements.in file uses the same requirements syntax as requirements.txt:\nI could indicate for example that I want Django==2.0.8 instead of the latest version.\nRunning pip-compile in the same folder will create a requirements.txt file:\n\npip-compile automatically grabbed the latest versions and each line not present\nin your requirements.in has a comment indicating why it is here. This is already\na big improvement over pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt.\nRemember the packages hashes mentioned before? pip-compile --generate-hashes can automatically computes the hashes and put them\nin the generated file:\n\nThe initial run takes a bit of time but subsequent ones take under a second.\nThe last thing we need for package management is an easy way to upgrade the packages and\npip-compile provides that out of the box:\n\npip-compile --upgrade will update all packages\npip-compile -P PACKAGE_NAME will update only that package\n\nAn astute reader might have noticed that so far we have only managed to write and update\na text file and have not actually installed anything. That's where pip-sync comes into play.\nRunning pip-sync requirements.txt will compare the packages listed in the file with\nwhat is currently installed, installing the missing packages and uninstalling the packages\nnot listed. This ensures your virtualenv doesn't have extra dependencies and is representing\naccurately your requirements file.\nThe main con I have is pretty silly: why is it pip-compile and pip-sync instead of piptools compile\nand piptools sync?\nPipenv\nPipenv is developed by the Python Packaging Authority,\nresponsible for developing pip so I had big expectations.\nIt is inspired by Cargo/Bundler/Yarn and introduces 2 files that you will recognize if you used any of them before:\n\na Pipfile: a TOML file listing packages as well as a minimal Python version\na Pipfile.lock: a lockfile in JSON format listing every dependencies version with their hash\n\nAnytime you want to install the dependencies, Pipenv will read Pipfile.lock and install everything in it.\nTo make it easier for users, Pipenv also wraps virtualenv, getting rid of the need to have virtualenvwrapper. Pipenv seems\nto be only targeting applications, it doesn't help if you are packaging a library.\nLet's see how it works in practice.\nThe first step is to create a new project: pipenv --python 3.7.\nThis is a pretty strange command as pipenv only displays the help so I would have expected the command to be pipenv new\nrather than some flags. Typically flags in this situation are only there to display information, like pipenv --version.\nPipenv will also create a new virtualenv when running pipenv install if there isn't one.\nTo activate the newly created virtualenv, run pipenv shell. To exit it, simply type exit.\nRunning pipenv install django will do two things:\n\ninsert django = \"*\" in the packages table of the Pipfile\ndownload the latest django version, install it in the virtual env and add the hash/version in Pipfile.lock\n\nPutting \"*\" as a version number is not great: I need to read the Pipfile.lock to see which version was installed\nand * is never a good default for a version number, even with a lockfile. Changing it to django = \"==2.1.1\" which was\nthe version it installed did the trick.\nYou can run pipenv sync to do the equivalent of pip-sync from pip-tools, but using Pipfile.lock as the truth this time.\nPipenv actually uses pip-tools for some of its commands under the hood.\nA cool feature of Pipenv is pipenv check that will check for security issues in your packages. Running a slightly\noutdated version of Django for example gives the following:\n\n\nPEP 508 is the grammar defining how to write dependencies versions, i.e. the == for example you\nhave seen before in that article.\n\nPipenv seems extremely slow: running pipenv install -d the test project with already pinned versions took 166s.\nAlmost 3 minutes. Running it again right after took 55s. Any action dealing with packages\ntakes a minimum of 30s on my machine. I did say in the introduction that speed is not too important but Pipenv does test the limit\nof that affirmation.\nLastly, I found the UX of the whole tool to be pretty awkward or buggy:\n\npipenv shows an help menu with the various actions but pipenv check --help for example will not tell you\nwhat pipenv check actually does, only what flags are available\npipenv uninstall is said to \"Un-installs a provided package and removes it from Pipfile.\" but somehow pipenv uninstall --three \nwill destroy the current virtualenv and create a new one? It looks like all subcommands have the same flags available to\ncreate/recreate a virtualenv instead of having a pipenv new command and avoid this pitfall.\nerrors are very cryptic: I made a typo while adding a dependency in Pipfile resulting in an invalid TOML variable and all I got was\ntwo tracebacks for a total of 70 lines with the reason on the last line. How about only showing me the reason instead?\npipenv update doesn't tell what was actually updated...?\npipenv update django updates all the packages instead of only django....?\n\npoetry\nI believe I first heard of poetry while looking up Black and noticing\na pyproject.toml.\nPEP 518 introduced pyproject.toml:\n\nThis PEP specifies how Python software packages should specify what build dependencies they have in order\nto execute their chosen build system.\nAs part of this specification, a new configuration file is introduced for software packages to use to specify\ntheir build dependencies (with the expectation that the same configuration file will be used for future configuration details).\n\nThe interesting part of that PEP for the purpose of this article is the tool section.\nRather than having one config file for each tool like Flake8 or Black, having\nall of them consolidated in one file would be very valuable.\nPoetry uses this file to list the dependencies, keeping everything neatly in place.\nThere are two ways to get started with poetry:\n\npoetry new SOME_NAME: will create a folder named SOME_NAME with some basic structure setup for a Python project\npoetry init: an interactive way to setup your project and some dependencies\n\nThe downside of the poetry init is that the package search is not that great: searching for django will\nreturn a list of 99 packages, all of them being django-something and not the actual django. I don't know what Pypi\noffers as an API so maybe it is a limitation of the API but even then, showing 99 results is not very user friendly and\nif there is an exact match it should show it to you.\nThe help text says I can enter the exact package name but typing django tries to autocomplete with the package names\nfrom the list and results in an error:\n\nPoetry will also create virtualenv automatically when running install, add or remove with the current version of python:\nyou cannot currently create a virtualenv with a different version.\nYou are supposed to activate a shell with poetry shell but it breaks if you using $WORKON_HOME for other tools:\nhttps://github.com/sdispater/poetry/issues/214 so I ended up ignoring the virtualenv related commands. I didn't spend time looking\ninto it so there might be an easy fix but it should work out of the box with the rest of the ecosystem.\nIf you try to install a package using poetry add django, you will notice that a pyproject.lock has been created\nand that some dependencies were added to pyproject.toml:\n\nAs opposed to the other tools, poetry uses the semantic versioning to refer to dependencies versions. If you have used\nCargo in Rust, you will feel at home. The issue is that many Python libraries do not use\nsemantic versioning so it does feel a bit weird to use in this context.\nWhile trying to clean its cache to test the speed, I ran into a small UX issue.\nPoetry offers a command to clean the cache (poetry cache:clear) but it takes a path/string to a cache as an argument. A new\nuser like me will not know what argument to give, especially since the command is not in the documentation.\nLooking into issues, we can see that we can run poetry cache:clear --all pypi but the documentation doesn't even mention cache:clear so it's not\nobvious.\nAs expected, the initial poetry install takes some time but subsequent runs take under a second.\nThe UI is very clean and clear about what was installed and their versions.\nPoetry also has poetry update to update dependencies and once again makes it clear what has changed.\nWhile this post is focused on backend applications, it is worth mentioning that Poetry apparently handles building and publishing\nlibraries as well which is a big plus if you are a maintainer: one tool for all purposes!\nMy opinion\nI have only mentioned 3 tools but there are way more! I wouldn't be surprised if Python had the highest\nnumber of tools dedicated to package and environment management of any programming language.\nSince all those tools are written in Python themselves you still need to use Pip first to install them, globally sometimes. A better solution\nin my opinion would be to write the package manager in a language compiling down to a binary, solving the bootstrapping issue and\nbeing a good example of https://xkcd.com/927/.\nTo go back to the three tools mentioned in this article, I would recommend either pip-tools or poetry.\nMy limited usage of Pipenv had too many WTFs to be considered ready for actual use, not even taking into account\nits extreme slowness. I'm not entirely sure why it is the recommended tool other than the virtualenv setup was easy to do because it feels\nlike an alpha version. If you are using Docker containers instead of virtualenvs, I don't see any advantage of Pipenv over pip-tools or Poetry.\nI like the simplicity of pip-tools. If you are currently writing requirements.txt by hand, using pip-tools to get\nsome extra features like hashes is a pretty small step to take which I would recommend right now.\nOn the other hand, if pyproject.toml gets adopted by other tools (Flake8, mypy etc), having everything in one file would be very\nappealing and poetry would become the best choice at that time. I expect poetry to work with my current use of virtualenvwrapper though,\nI don't want to convert all my projects to poetry just to make it happy.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/overview-package-management-python/","title":"An overview of package management in Python in 2018"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/podcast-rocks/":{"body":"概述\nPodcast实际上就是加了一些iTunes特定标签的RSS.规范见Apple中国-制作播客, 或参见英文版.\n而Podcast的RSS格式挺麻烦的, 懒得读文档的话, 可以直接使用Podcast RSS在线生成器.\niTunes并不负责托管你的mp3/m4a/mp4/epub等文件, 因此你需要自行解决.\nRSS按格式写好之后, 可以通过iTunes或iPhone的播客来订阅, 也可以测试通过之后, 提交给iTunes Store, 来借Apple的平台进行推广.\n哦对了, 还需要准备一个1400x1400像素的方形图做Logo.\n最后直接开一个Apache, 把RSS内容写到podcast.xml(或其它的xml名字), 发布订阅就好啦.\nBug 1:\n貌似这个在线生成器生成的pubDate字段有问题, 可能导致原生的podcast显示的时间为2001年1月1日, 按Apple的说法是要严格符合RFC 2822\n\n重定向\n如果你的订阅URL中途有变动, iTunes提供了一个标签用于重定向, 省去通知原有订户的烦恼. \n在Channel段里加一个new-feed-url即可:\n\n订阅方法\n\n电脑上的iTunes\niPhone上的播客\n\nMarco Arment 的 Overcast, 目前 Overcast 2.0 免费啦, 推荐尝试.\niOS 上比较推荐的还有 Castro, 虽然是收费的. \n虽然 iOS 9 原生的改进不错, 但是据说还不咋地\n\n\nAndroid上的Podcast &amp; Radio Addict\n\nGoogle在2018年推出的原生Podcast客户端\n\n\nLinux 的 banshee, rythmbox, amarok\n\n\n\n如何订阅 IPN 出品的播客? \n首先你需要一个泛用型（或称通用型）播客客户端软件. 在 iOS 上我们第一推荐的是Castro. 若您暂时不打算为播客客户端付费, 也可以用苹果自家出的那个紫色图标的 Podcasts, 它是免费的, 并已预装在了 iOS 8 上. 在九月即将推出的 iOS 9 里, Podcasts 会全面更新. \n在安卓上我们推荐 Pocket Casts, 但很遗憾国内安卓市场上的 Pocket Casts 均为盗版. 若您无法在 Google Play 购买 Pocket Casts, 我们推荐开源且免费的 AntennaPod. ​\n(from http://ipn.li/faq)\n\n\n参考\n\nhttp://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/creatorfaq.html\n另一个Generator: http://clintbellanger.net/itunesrss/\n另另一个Generator: http://www.podtopia.net/\n\n与 Jekyll 集成\n后来我们基于Jekyll实现了一个Markdown博客自动导出podcast.xml的项目, 见https://github.com/tuna/podcast. \n附1: 可以接受的几种转码方式\n1.

My usual process is to look at the last project I worked on, \ntry to extract all the base dependencies and configuration and see if a Hello World still works after upgrading everything.\nThis problem might be alleviated with tools such as create-react-app but\nI personally prefer not having an abstraction layer for the configuration as it is something I always end up having to\ntweak. Even when using frameworks like Next.js where the configuration is hidden, you still need\nto make some changes and understanding Webpack goes a long way in the frontend world.\nThe article is split in two parts: \n\nGetting a local dev environment set up: this article\nMaking it production ready: part 2\n\nThe focus for these article is to set up a build process for modern browsers with TypeScript: I am not going to pick any library other than React.\nState management, testing framework etc are all up to you. The slight\nexception to that rule is that I will use Sass to handle the styling rather than alternatives such as Less/CSS-in-JS.\nOnce again, this is up to you. If you prefer to use JS for your CSS, just skip the last section of this article.\nI am also going to use yarn as package manager but npm will work as well.\nYou can view the end result in https://github.com/Keats/webpack-react-typescript.\nTypeScript setup\nTypeScript is the most important tool for me in the frontend world. I first talked about \nit on this blog in 2014 and it only got better with time. This is a superset of JavaScript, simply adding \ntypes to it. I don't think static typing in dynamic languages are controversial anymore, seeing how many languages adopt it.\nStatic typing is the ultimate form of documentation as it HAS to be correct.\nLet's add it to the project:\n\nThis will create your project package.json as well as a lock file: yarn.lock.\nThe next step is to create a tsconfig.json, containing our TypeScript configuration:\n\nLet's go through them quickly:\n\nmodule and esModuleInterop: ensures we use the latest module system and compatible with the Babel ecosystem\nmoduleResolution: look into the node_modules folder for packages\ntarget: we target modern browsers so ES6 is fine here. If you need IE11 support, change it to es5\njsx: we use React and transpile from TypeScript directly so we use react\nsourceMap: we want them\nstrict: enable all the strict flags automatically\n\nAll the other options are adding some additional checks, such as not allowing unused variables and a list \nof all the options can be found in TypeScript documentation.\nLastly, we set up an include path containing \"./src/**/*\": we will put all our code in a src folder.\nIn this setup, we will only use TypeScript and not Babel. It is possible to use TypeScript for\ntypechecking only and pass the code to Babel for transpilation but, unless you need a specific Babel plugin, there are no \nreasons to do that nowadays. You will have to wait a few more months before getting stage 3 features - not a big deal.\nThe commit for that step can be seen in https://github.com/Keats/webpack-react-typescript/commit/a083ce1511b15c51d4a8d3ef95f2da05a669758b.\nWebpack setup\nLet's start the slightly more complex part! Once you understand how Webpack works, this is actually pretty simple.\nWebpack itself\nWe first need webpack and its CLI:\n\nLet's also create a file named webpack.config.js as well as a src folder and an empty index.tsx file in it.\nLastly, I always set up an .editorconfig file to let text editors sync on how to format things.\nA very basic configuration for Webpack doing nothing would be something like:\n\nThis means we are using src/index.tsx as the entry point (e.g. what Webpack is loading) and the output will be created in\nthe dist directory, containing the hash in the filename for caching reasons.\nWe use eval-source-map as devtool value as this is the best setting for development, You can see all the different values\nin the Webpack devtool documentation. Finally, we let Webpack know that\nit should try to load imports with no extensions as .js, .jsx, .ts and .tsx (so we can do import something from \"../index\") and add a script to build our project.\n\nRunning that script (yarn build) will create the dist folder containing a file with a name like app.5730f5cdf8cb70458282.js.\nSince we didn't write any code yet, it currently only contains Webpack's own code.\nThe commit for those changes is in https://github.com/Keats/webpack-react-typescript/commit/48fc3f342c3f4f53c30af1b457d90351f442b4f0.\nLoaders and plugin\nIn this article we are aiming for a simple SPA without SSR so let's setup a super basic React application in order to actually bundle something.\n\nReact doesn't ship the TypeScript type definitions by default so we need to download them manually.\nThe simplest React code we can write in src/index.tsx is:\n\nThis will render the React app in the HTML element with id root, which, as some of you might have noticed, doesn't exist yet.\nThere is a plugin that will handle the HTML for us: html-webpack-plugin.\n\nWe are using this plugin here because we do not need to display dynamic &lt;meta&gt; attributes depending on the page. If you\nneed it for SEO or other reasons, you will need to use another approach, likely involving some kind of SSR.\nEnabling it in our webpack.config.js is trivial:\n\nThe template can be something very basic such as:\n\nDo remember that the id of a container needs to match the one set in index.tsx.\nTrying to run the build against at this point will give you an error about a missing loader for this type of file, referring\nto our index.tsx.\nThe commit for the above is https://github.com/Keats/webpack-react-typescript/commit/3af8820f98b3645381edfb99792700922823394b.\nLoaders are the way Webpack knows what to do with each filetype. In our case, we have these TypeScript files but we didn't tell\nWebpack what to do with them: we need to add a loader for it. In the case of TypeScript, we will add a plugin in addition.\n\nThe reason we use a loader and a plugin is performance: the loader will only perform transpilation while the plugin\nwill typecheck in another thread.\n\nThose changes are in the commit https://github.com/Keats/webpack-react-typescript/commit/a3fdbade49deaffd4b5cd762021920efad0fbc8c.\nRunning yarn build again will now bundle our code: just open dist/index.html to check for yourself. While opening that folder,\nyou might have noticed that there are many .js files in there: we never actually cleaned that folder. \nNothing a Webpack plugin (clean-webpack-plugin) or a rm -rf dist/ in the script cannot solve.\nThe commit for the plugin way is https://github.com/Keats/webpack-react-typescript/commit/42ca8ba4f4ec0312d26defef610f7652a26ce40c.\nwebpack-dev-server\nWe have our build working now but it builds from scratch every time, which sucks.\nThankfully, Webpack has some nice tooling with its dev server allowing Hot Modules Replacement (HMR): live reloading of your code\nwithout having to refresh.\n\nAnd update webpack.config.js:\n\nAnd add a new script, dev with a value of webpack-dev-server. Running yarn dev will now run a local server on\nport 9000 that will also recompiles on change and reload the components without causing a refresh: try it for yourself\nby changing the text index.tsx while having the page open.\nLet's backtrack a bit to explain the devServer options though. As always, the complete documentation is available\non Webpack documentation but the key options there are:\n\nhot: yes please, we do want HMR\nhistoryApiFallback: if your app is a SPA with navigation you will need that option enabled to not see 404s\noverlay: display errors as an overlay on the app, useful to ensure you're not missing it out from the terminal\nstats: Webpack is very noisy by default, this turns the output level to something more reasonable\n\nFor the changes in the plugins section, we do disable async of ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin to have overlay still\nwork as well as adding the builtin HMR plugin.\nThe commit is https://github.com/Keats/webpack-react-typescript/commit/ed546d935487f4e4350e5267261b2c6a7bac015b.\nAt this point we have a functional working setup but there are a couple of tools we can add to improve the code quality.\nAuto-formatting\nPrettier is a very nice tool to format pretty much every language used in the JavaScript world.\n\nPrettier is opinionated and as such has few options to configure. The only change I like to make is setting the maximum\nnumber of characters in a line to be 100 instead of the default 80. It can be configured directly from package.json.\n\nAs well as a new script fmt: prettier --write 'src/**/**.ts*' that will format all TypeScript files in the src folder.\nThe main issue is that for these tools to matter, they need to be enforced. An easy way to do that is via a commit hook, using\nsomething like husky. As with prettier, we can configure husky easily in package.json:\n\nwhere fmt:check is a new script that only checks whether there are files needing to be formatted: prettier --list-different 'src/**/**.ts*'.\nThe next time someones working on that project calls git commit, this command will be ran before and will fail if any file\nneeds formatting. Don't forget to run this command in your CI as well!\nThe commit is https://github.com/Keats/webpack-react-typescript/commit/a464f58d80af0aa45be55bd3df87bb00d74ed958.\nLinting\nThe last code quality tooling we are going to add is ESLint. Setting it up requires a few more \ndependencies than the other tools as we need to make it work with React, Prettier and Typescript.\n\nThe configuration is kept in a file named .estlintrc.js:\n\nEssentially we tell ESLint that we are going to use TypeScript and what configuration to use for the parser,\nenable the recommended lints for React and TypeScript and lastly we add prettier/@typescript-eslint to disable all rules\nconflicting with prettier. I also disable the react/prop-types linting rule as we are using TypeScript and actually\nhave strongly typed props already.\nThe linting script in our case is \"lint\": \"eslint 'src/**/**.ts*'\".\nThe commit is https://github.com/Keats/webpack-react-typescript/commit/f30c07b1564457e55f9110c32ca766caf060b34d.\nBonus: Sass handling\nYou can skip that section if you prefer using some CSS-in-JS.\n\nAs you might have understood already, we need to add some loaders to handle Sass files in our Webpack config:\n\nAnd then you need to tell Webpack to load the root file by importing it into your index.tsx file, in my case \nimport \"./style/app.scss\";. If you added scss to resolve.extensions in the Webpack configuration, you can skip the .scss.\nLive reload will continue to work with Sass editing: you can change the background colour and see it immediately reflected\nin your browser.\nThis setup will not solve the classic CSS specificity issues where some changes in a component might affect another component, unless\nyou are well disciplined with naming classes such as using BEM. One nice automatic solution to that\nare CSS modules but that will likely be a separate article.\nPrettier also works with Sass so we can just add .scss file to the format script and it will work automatically.\nThe commit is https://github.com/Keats/webpack-react-typescript/commit/055c4785da3d167a18137a90c4ca887fddf7feed, I've also\nrun Prettier manually on the configuration files to have consistent formatting throughout the project.\nWhat's next\nWith that, we have a working development setup. It is not production and deployment ready however and that is what we will look at\nin the second part.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/react-typescript-webpack-1/","title":"Setting up a React+TypeScript frontend with Webpack — Part 1"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/react-typescript-webpack-2/":{"body":"In this article, we are going to turn our local environment setup into\na production-ready setup.

You can install cross-env to handle cross-platform environment variables. \nThe script in that case is \"build:prod\": \"cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack\".\nAgain, if you do not need Windows support, simply remove the cross-env from the script.\nNow there are two ways to proceed:\n\nsplit the configuration in multiple files and merge them with something like webpack-merge\nkeep everything in one file and use JavaScript to toggle things\n\nI prefer the second approach as I find it more readable and doesn't require additional dependencies. You can judge for yourself\nby looking at the final result.\nAs mentioned before, Webpack has been making things easier. With the introduction of mode, it is easy\nto get a production-ready bundle:\n\nJust changing the mode will get us a minified output: you can check it by running build:prod yourself. \nLooking at the minified code, we can see that the sourcemap is embedded in the file still. \nThe best option for production environments\nis source-map which we can set conditionally on the isProd variable: devtool: isProd ? \"source-map\" : \"eval-source-map\",.\nRunning build:prod again will now properly create a separate file ending in .js.map.\nRemember that the sourcemap files should not be accessible by anyone other than you and your bug reporting app.\nLastly, the HMR from Webpack is injecting some code in the bundle that we do not want in our production bundle. We can disable it easily:\n\nThe commit is https://github.com/Keats/webpack-react-typescript/commit/4527184f2d7a49447451774b1bf5cc8d4cb3c1e5.\nSplitting chunks\nIn our current situation, we generate a single file for the whole app: it clocks in at 132KB before gzip.\nThis means that every time someone changes anything in the codebase, the full bundle will be invalidated and re-downloaded by every users.\nThere are two approaches to splitting the chunks:\n\nbundle splitting: separating into fixed bundles, for example putting dependencies into another bundle\ncode splitting: splitting your own code into multiple bundles loaded on demand\n\nBundle splitting\nThe easiest bundle splitting strategy is to create a vendors bundle containing all dependencies. In our case we currently\nonly have react and react-dom but it will inevitably grow and, unless you are upgrading dependencies every day, will not\nchange very often. Dividing the bundle does not change anything for first-time users as they will have to download all files but\nrepeat users will only download the bundles that changed.\nWebpack comes with a built-in option to split everything coming from the node_modules folder to another bundle: optimization.splitChunks.chunks.\nSetting it to \"all\" will produce a new JavaScript file with a name starting by vendors~app in the output directory weighting 131KB while the app bundle shrank down to 1.9KB.\nIf you run build:prod again after making a change to index.tsx, you will notice the hash did change: we need to ensure the hash\nis done on the content rather than the build. In practice this means changing [hash] to [contenthash] in the output.filename configuration in production.\nTrying it again will now give the expected results: a change in our application code doesn't change the vendors bundle.\nFor many apps, just splitting the bundle that way will be enough to get started. If needed, you can create different kind\nof strategies, for example:\n\none file per npm dependency\ngroup packages per update of frequency: put the ones that change often in the same bundle\ngroup packages per kind: all React packages could go in one bundle, all data viz in another etc\nhave multiple entry points: Webpack will create one file per entry point\n\nThe Webpack documentation \nhas some examples demonstrating how to implement some of the strategies. Once again, start with the default dumb splitting and experiment as you go when needed.\nThe commit is https://github.com/Keats/webpack-react-typescript/commit/cd2669b62d9542794fdc52e6e6fb1702716ddc36.\nCode splitting\nCode splitting is allowing you to import some code on demand. It relies on the dynamic import() proposal which\nis now on stage 4, eg finished. A simple React example would be:\n\nImagine that the locationModal component is loading Leaflet and that this is the only place\nwhere it is used. With the bundle splitting, Leaflet would be in your bundle even for users never seeing that form. If you are\ndoing code splitting, you will obviously need to make sure Leaflet is not part of another chunk. Another\nobvious contender for code splitting is data visualisation: plottting libraries are typically heavy and if you only have them in one page you can split it from your bundle to\nprovide a faster experience for everyone.\nCode splitting is very powerful but not that useful if you are just starting: worry about it when your codebase is bigger. If you\nare using React, the documentation page on code splitting is very well written and should\nanswer most questions on how to actually use it.\nTo use code splitting with TypeScript, you will also need to change module in tsconfig.json to esnext.\nAnalyzing bundles\nOnce you have your bundle(s), a useful step is to actually check what they contain and whether there is fat that can be trimmed.\nwebpack-bundle-analyzer is shining for that usecase.\n\nWe only need to analyze bundles once in a while so I like to create a new script for it \"analyze\": \"cross-env NODE_ENV=production ANALYZE=true webpack\", and\nonly instantiate the plugin when that ANALYZE environment variable is set to true. \nRunning analyze will give you a treemap visualisation of each package used and their size, with and without gzip.\nUsing this tool, it becomes very easy to notice some packages taking way more spaces than they should. The most classic examples I've seen\npersonally are not removing Momentjs locales for an English only site and having the full Lodash while\nonly using one or two functions.\nThe commit is https://github.com/Keats/webpack-react-typescript/commit/41190ae6e279c84c8614d5d77656b8afaed1dea3.\nExtracting CSS\nIf you added Sass by following the previous article and looked at the bundle analyzer results, you might have noticed that the app bundle contains CSS. That's because\nwe've inlined them in our configuration via style-loader and need to extract it to a separate CSS file in production environment instead using a plugin.\n\nThe change is pretty straightforward: we load the MiniCssExtractPlugin loader instead of style-loader in production and\nadd the plugin to the plugin list. The plugin can be set for every environment as it will not do anything unless the loader\nis also used.\nRunning build:prod will now create a CSS file as well as a sourcemap in the dist folder. I'm not 100% sure the sourcemap\nis accurate as I have never used them for CSS.\nThe commit is https://github.com/Keats/webpack-react-typescript/commit/e97a368d67e88f2c1adb9b018b8a4164fdfd3283.\nConclusion\nIf you followed the articles or just cloned the repository, you should be in a good place to start actually building your project.\nIt might look complicated compared to create-react-app but this is a minimal setup\nthat you understand and that only has things what you need. Well, being a JavaScript project it still pulls way too many dependencies just for that but \nit's a good start.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/react-typescript-webpack-2/","title":"Setting up a React+TypeScript frontend with Webpack — Part 2"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/releasing-gutenberg-010/":{"body":"Gutenberg is a powerful static site engine inspired by Hugo but simpler to use.\nYou can build pretty much any kind of static site with it using markdown:\n\na basic blog\na landing site\na knowledge base\na gitbook\na documentation site\nall of the above combined\n\nYou can download built binaries from the Github releases page.

For example\n{{ youtube(id=\"dQw4w9WgXcQ\") }} is a built-in shortcode and will insert the YouTube video for that id.\nSass compilation\nRSS feed generation when requested\nTags and categories generation when requested\nco-location of assets and content: when an article has some images and you want to keep them in the same folder\n\nWhat's next\nThe current features are pretty much what I wanted to have when I started Gutenberg but that doesn't mean there isn't anything left to do!\ni18n\nThe discussion started on github but as it isn't a feature I need, I would\nrather have someone else doing it, once there is consensus on the implementation\nAlternative rendering backends\nRight now, only markdown is supported. While I definitely don't want to have too many backend, Asciidoc\nis one I was interested in and antoyo started working on a asciidoc implementation so\nit should be coming eventually!\nTheme support\nAn issue was opened on Gutenberg to support themes.\nWhile the idea in the issue is IMO too complex, I would like to have some theme support baked in gutenberg,\nunless the git clone a-template-repo approach is simpler.\nDeploying\nA subcommand to upload/push the generated site to Github Pages/server/service could be nice. Maybe this can be resolved\nwith documentation instead though.\nA documentation site\nNow that things are a bit more stable in Gutenberg, I will start working on a documentation site as Gutenberg Readme is currently not\nnearly enough. I've already started one for Tera and am mostly waiting for design inspiration\nbefore publishing it.\nPackaging\nLastly, I think it's time to put Gutenberg in packages managers. I will probably\nput it on AUR if no one beats me to it but I will need help for the other package managers.\nConclusion\nAs always I welcome any feedback.

You can view the CHANGELOG for\na quick overview: I will look at the biggest changes in more details here including the breaking ones and how to migrate.\nBreaking: custom taxonomies\nTaxonomies are a way to group content together, the most common one in blogs being tags and categories.\nBefore 0.4.0, you could only have those two taxonomies: tags and categories. You\ncouldn't paginate their pages, have a RSS feed for each or create your own taxonomy.\nLet's see how to use, and also how to migrate from the point of view of a current user\nalready using tags/categories.\nIf you are looking for more information, the docs have been updated — look\nfor the various taxonomies pages in the side menu.\nUpdating the configuration\nThe first thing to do is open your config.toml and list the taxonomies you want to use:\n\nUpdating the templates\nWe need to change two things regarding the taxonomies templates:\n\ntheir location\nthe main variable they use\n\nFirst we need to move the templates their new location:\n\ntags.html -&gt; tags/list.html\ntag.html -&gt; tags/single.html\ncategories.html -&gt; categories/list.html\ncategory.html -&gt; categories/single.html\n\nIn short, Gutenberg is now looking for:\n\n$TAXONOMY_NAME/single.html\n$TAXONOMY_NAME/list.html\n\nLastly, the name of the variables available have changed:\n\nreplace tags and categories with terms\nreplace tag and category with term\n\nUpdating the content\nBefore, your front-matter would look like:\n\nAn updated version is:\n\nNote that every taxonomies is now required to take an array of string, whereas before\nthere could be only a single category.\nBreaking: removal of order sorting &amp; renaming of next/previous\nBefore 0.4.0, you could sort pages by date, order and weight.\norder and weight were the opposite of each other but the difference of meaning led\nto confusion when trying to get the previous or the next page.\nTo make things more explicit two changes have been made:\n\norder has been removed\npage.previous and page.next have been renamed depending on the sorting used:\n\ndate: now called page.earlier and page.later\nweight: now called page.lighter and page.heavier\n\n\n\nNo more &lt;a class=\"previous\" href=\"{{page.next.permalink}}&gt;{{page.next.title}}&lt;/a&gt;!\nTo fix sites using order or date, you will need to:\n\nchange sort_by of the sections to use weight\nrename order to weight and invert the order of values if necessary\nrename next and previous to heavier/lighter or later/earlier\n\nThis has been implemented by Daniel Sockwell as his first ever Rust PR!\nDaniel has also made tons of improvements to the documentation, something always appreciated.\nImage processing\nThis is the amazing work of Vojtech Kral who also wrote\na thorough documentation page explaining it in detail.\nIn short: you can now resize images from a template and implementing a gallery is trivial. Open an issue if you have an idea for\nsome image processing not already in!\nShortcodes fixes\nIn the previous versions, shortcodes were detected with a Regex and built up\nwhile parsing the Markdown which ended up being some of the worst spaghetti code I have ever written.\nIt lead to numerous bugs as well some valuable features like array arguments to be almost impossible to implement — at least for me.\nIn Gutenberg 0.4.0, shortcodes are now rendered before Markdown as a separate pass, going through a custom parser specifically written for it.\nThe rendered shortcodes are then inserted back into the Markdown as raw HTML so the (much simplified) Markdown parser can ignore them.\nThanks to that redesign, all shortcodes feature requests were added easily and every known bug has been fixed.\nExternal link checker\nLink rot can be a big issue: some pages might not make sense anymore as a whole if an important link stopped working.\nSince Gutenberg already checks internal links, only external links were left to check!\nSimply add check_external_links = true to your config.toml and Gutenberg will look up every link in your pages, reporting the ones\nnot working.\nThis process is quite slow though so I would recommend enabling it once in a while to check but not all the time.\nKeep in mind that some results might be false negatives: crates.io for example always returns a 404.\nWhat's next\nThe main goal for the next version is i18n support. There is an open RFC to\ndiscuss how the implementation would look like, comments are very welcome.\nThe main issue left seems to be the translation of the template texts as I'm not sure how to handle that.\nRight now it's a dictionary in config.toml but that can grow to be quite large so a separate file for each language\nwould make sense. Pluralization also becomes an issue.\nOnce the spec is clearly defined on all points, I would happy to mentor people of any skill level on bits of it: gutenberg is divided in\nmany sub-crates, making changes pretty self-contained.\nAs always if you have any feedback or bugs, please open an issue.

This is an important update for Gutenberg users - please read on\nif you are one of them.\nGutenberg/Zola is a powerful static site generator (SSG)\ninspired by Hugo but simpler to use. One of its goals is to try\nto do as much as possible at built time: anchors, search, Sass, table of contents, syntax highlighting and more.\nIt is highly flexible and allows you to do any kind of sites:\n\na blog like the one you are reading right now\na landing page\na knowledge base\na gitbook: see the book theme\na documentation site for your library like the one for Zola\n\nYou can find an up-to-date comparison of Zola with other SSG on the README.\nA bit of history and changing name to Zola\nThe first commit on Gutenberg was done in May 2015 after the first stable version of Rust was released.\nThe goal for that project was for a friend and I to learn Rust and a SSG was a pretty good fit for that.\nSince it was a learning project, we didn't really care about name conflict: we expected to be the only\nusers.\n\nIf you are looking at the date of the first commit in the GitHub repo, you will see 2016.\nWhen I started Gutenberg, there was no templates library I liked at the time so I spent some time\nbuilding Tera and deleted the original repo as it was outdated by then.\n\nGutenberg grew more than anticipated and every time it got posted somewhere, half of the comments were pointing out\nthe name was not original. Most of the name conflicts were with Project Gutenberg or\nsome CSS frameworks. I fully agree\nwith the people saying it isn't original. By that time, Gutenberg was already in many package managers and on Netlify:\nchanging name was a bit problematic.\nMore recently though, a small project called WordPress started advertising their new editor, gutenberg.\nBeing WordPress it will simply eclipse every single search for my Gutenberg and any others: I\nalready had trouble finding one of the CSS framework named Gutenberg while writing this post since all results were about the WordPress editor, which isn't\neven released yet at that time.\nAnother point against the Gutenberg name is that my SO works for a WordPress agency: I hear about it all the time.\nI opened an issue to rename the project and ended up choosing zola.\nÉmile Zola is a very famous French writer - at least in France -, mainly for his J'accuse letter. His\nwriting style doesn't appeal to everyone but his most famous books are L'Assomoir\nand Germinal if you want to read one.\nThe name zola itself it very short, easy to pronounce and I couldn't find any open-source projects with that name other than an inactive organization.\nAs the name is brand new, zola will not be available immediately in all package managers and not natively on Netlify as I will talk about a bit more below.\nChangelog\n0.5.0 took longer than expected but is packed with bug fixes, new features and improvements. Part of the reason this\nversion has been so slow to be released is that I wanted to have Netlify support on release since all my sites\nare using it. However, since my PR to add it is not really being looked at, I decided\nto stop waiting and release it now.\nIf you are using the current Gutenberg Netlify support, you can either stay on 0.4.1 or 0.4.2 or download the zola binary manually like\nmentioned in the documentation.\nWith that said, let's have a look at the headlines.\nPerformance\nA big focus for this release was performance. While fast enough for medium sites (&lt; 500 pages), it was slowing down\nand consuming lots of memory when dealing with bigger sites and I knew some of the features\nI wanted to add would make the problem even worse. Thanks to the help of @Freaky, we were\nable to improve speed dramatically (4-10x in general) while lowering the memory usage, you can see the evolution in the issue.\nTo give an idea of the speed, there are some benchmarks in the repository but you will need to generate them first: python gen.py in components/site/benches.\nThis will generate several sites of various sizes and setup but I'll use huge-blog for illustration.\nIt is a blog with 10000 pages, paginated by 5 with several taxonomies (one of them having a RSS feed).\nEach page contains shortcode, syntax highlighting and, although not used in the templates in this cases, a table of contents.\nHere are the results on my 4.5 years old laptop:\n\nNot too bad. I am pretty sure we can optimize the speed further but I won't spend more time on it myself, I would rather\ntry to lower the memory usage right now, which is still way too high: I believe it used around 3GB during the screenshot above, which is insanely\nhigh.\nMost of the time spent is now serializing the data to JSON for usage in Tera.\nThere is an issue for writing Tera's own serde format but I am not sure how it would look like\ndespite the help of @dtolnay. If you have ideas on how to improve on that side, I am very happy to hear them!\nAncestry\nEach page and section will now have all their parent sections paths in an ancestors property.\nThis allows you to easily do breadcrumbs as well as just being able to access the parent section, which wasn't possible before.\nLoading CSV/TOML/JSON data\nA new Tera function aptly named load_data has been added.\nIt can load data from both a local file or a remote URL and convert it to Tera values for usage in templates. As such, this is equivalent\nto the feature some SSG call data files but also to getJSON and getCSV in Hugo. Thanks to serde\nfor the super simple and powerful serializations!\nDate from filename\nIf a page with a YYYY-MM-DD{-,_} format, this date will now automatically be set as the page date, unless\noverwritten in the front-matter, and the text after {-,_} will be the slug.\nFor now, a slug is still required but it seems likely that I will allow a file named YYYY-MM-DD in the future\nas, in some cases like meeting minutes, pages do not always have a slug different from the date.\nPage templates\nPreviously, if you had a site that was for example a landing page + blog, it is likely you would need\nto specify the template to use to render a blog post on every page. A bit tedious and not very DRY.\nFrom 0.5.0, you can set the page_template attribute in a section and every pages below that section including subsections pages will use it.\nSub-sections can override it by setting their own page_template and pages by setting template.\nTransparent sections\nA commonly requested feature was the YYYY/MM/DD url scheme. I do not think it is a good\none and explained why previously.\nHowever, someone had a very good idea: transparent section.\nBy setting transparent to true in a section front-matter, all its pages will be passed to the parent section and so on,\nuntil a section isn't transparent.\nIn practice, this allows you to do the YYYY/MM/DD scheme easily:\n\nIt is definitely more verbose than what Jekyll or Hugo (setting /:year/:month/:title/ in the config) but is also more powerful.\nAs far as I'm aware, you have no way of selecting the intermediate templates in alternatives or they are sometimes not rendered at all.\nFor example, if I'm on https://intellij-rust.github.io/2018/11/07/changelog-86.html and try\nto want to see all the posts in 2018 (https://intellij-rust.github.io/2018/), I get a 404. I would be very surprised\nif Jekyll doesn't handle that but it looks optional at least.\nAnother advantage is that it isn't limited to the data in the front-matter: you can organise it however you want. Want to have a blog, prefix all the blog posts\nby /blog/ but paginate it in the homepage? Create a blog section, mark it as transparent, paginate the index and you're done.\nBug fixes\nMany bugs were fixed, including the big Tera one with macros that was shipped in 0.4.2.\nRefer to the changelog for a full list.\nRoadmap\nThe first step now will be to get a Discourse up and running to have a better forum than GitHub and move all discussions/feature requests to it in\norder to keep the GitHub issues for actual bugs.\nThe major part of my effort will go towards Tera 1.0.0, with a beta version shipping in a future version\nof Zola soonish.\nI know I keep saying that on every release post but the focus for the next version will be on i18n support since some\nof the cleanup needed is now done. The RFC will need to be updated to take into account the new features in the last year once a Discourse instance is live.\nLastly, if you are looking for a place to get started with Rust, Zola is great for that!\nThe codebase is relatively small and separated in a few sub-crates making it easy to contribute: you can modify the bit you want to change in the sub-crate,\ncompile/test only that one and once you're satisfied check where is the compiler complaining in the rest of the project. I will also help personally anyone wanting to start working on an issue.\nThis offer is valid for any of my projects and if I don't respond for a while, don't hesitate to ping me.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/releasing-zola-0-5-0/","title":"Gutenberg is out, Zola 0.5.0 is in"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/speeding-up-django-postgres/":{"body":"Background\nAt my current contract, we process hundreds of thousand of articles a day and those are saved in some different models as we go along the pipeline. The stack for that application is Django (1.6) + PostgreSQL (9.3) + rq (alternative to the classic Celery for the queues).\nTasks started to take way too much time and so I started looking into.\nThis is not going to mention caching but things should obviously be cached if it is possible in your project.\nSpeeding up Django queries\nThe PostgreSQL database being on his own server, I assumed it was properly configured (spoiler: it wasn't) and thus started the investigation in the django project.\nThe models in that case are news articles, so it contains the text of the article (and it can get pretty big) as well as lots of metadata about it.\nAll in all, one of these objects can get pretty big (relatively speaking, keep in mind there are tens of millions of them) so getting/saving them can take some time.\nOnly\nMost of the time you do not need to get the whole object, you might want to only get one or two fields, very simple thing to do in SQL and in Django as well thanks to .only():\n\nThat sped up things in some places, but it was still pretty damn slow.\nUpdate fields\nLooking at the slow queries log (more on that in the postgres part below), the issue was very clear: when updating an article on one field, it was re-saving everything !\nDjango's ORM comes with an easy way to fix that:\n\nBulk create\nAnother thing to try was to bulk insert articles instead of creating them while looping:\n\nThere are a few caveats to be aware of when using using bulk_create, those are explained in the django doc.\nThat's three problems fixed. Still slow though.\nMass update\nIn the same spirit of the bulk_create, mass update will also speed up your code quite a bit:\n\nThis will be much faster than doing one update for each article individually as it will be done in a single SQL 'UPDATE' query.\nIndices\nAnother one was to add an index on a column that was used to filter but wasn't an index at all:\n\nAdding an index in postgres is pretty damn fast so do not be worried about the time it could take and sped up those queries significantly (ie they do not appear in the slow queries log).\nTransactions\nThe last trick is to wrap a method/bit of code to ensure atomicity.\nDjango provides a method usable both as a decorator and as a context manager allowing to do that:\n\nThis prevents from commiting every query and can speed up the piece of code significantly.\nUse that sparingly though as transactions can have some performance cost, make sure it's actually better before putting everything in transactions.\nAfter all these changes, the processing was faster but still super slow.\nI decided to then look at the DB server but just an additional tip before.\nBonus: select_related and prefetch_related\nAnother thing I didn't use there (because in my case I didn't need to select related objects) is select_related and prefetch_related.\nThose are used when you need to get associated models you know you will need later in your code and don't want to do a query for each.\nselect_related is used where you have a one-to-many or one-to-one (and do a JOIN in SQL in one query) and prefetch_related for many-to-one and many-to-many (do one query per type of object and join them in python).\nThis can shave a huge amount of queries from your total number of queries: at my last job it went from ~1000 to ~50 just by using those.\nFor example, let's say you have an Article and Author model and you want to display a template with the article content and the author data.\n\nYou can easily see from the example how it helps A LOT.\nTo easily spot the places where you can/should use them, install django-debug-toolbar and look at the SQL panels.\nPostgres speed improvement\nThe first thing I did (and I actually did it before doing most changes I mentioned in the django part) is to activate the slow queries logging.\nThis will make postgres log everything that takes can more than X seconds (where you define X).\nAll the changes mentioned below are done in postgresql.conf, located in /etc/postgresql/9.3/main (change 9.3 for your version obviously).\n\nThis allowed me to detect the slow queries caused by the absence of .only() and update_fields.\nAfter doing all the fixes in the Django code I was still seing ridiculously slow queries (a good number were taking more than 20s).\nNow when I added the slow queries logging, I noticed the absence of custom configuration at the bottom of the file.\nSurely if there's a server dedicated to the DB, postgres will have been tuned to use all the amazing amount of RAM available (I initially thought I had a bug when free -m told me the server had 64go of memory).\nThe tuning looks something like that (see the guide to know which values to choose):\n\nThis made everything run about 10x faster.\nConclusion\nMost of the time, the biggest bottleneck will be the database so do not forget that you are not using SQL and therefore you might make mistakes using an ORM (forgetting the update_fields for example) that you would never do in SQL.\nThe first thing to check would be the postgres config if queries are running slow but don't forget to optimize the django part as well.\nIn this project, some queries will still require tuning through EXPLAIN (probably worth a different article).\nIncluding the postgres tuning and the django changes, the code is running 10 and 100x faster than it was before.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/speeding-up-django-postgres/","title":"Speeding up Django /

lot if I did it at that time for multiple reasons — lack of skills and experience mainly — it became more achievable recently.\nIn 2013, I tried my hand at a product company to solve the recruitment process called Hizard where we failed before even getting a single customer because of a lack of time and a lack of motivation: hiring sector was a safe bet, not something we were particularly interested in.\nThe code for Hizard is available on github, a very simple django app.\nI then worked as a contractor, which is nice for the 100% pay raise compared to a full-time employee.\nThe only issue with contracting is being an 'ammo' can be loaded onto an existing project/team to add features but more likely to fix bugs rather than having a project from the beginning, which I enjoy much more.\nWith two other friends (including the one I did Hizard with), we thought it would be better to start our own company to work on interesting projects and have more freedom to work on open-source things (one of the guy worked at Google, which is pretty strict regarding that).\nThat's how we decided to create an agency/tech consultancy focusing on backends and interesting problems (think machine learning for example) rather than your run-of-the-mill digital agency doing CMS work.\nThe company was incorporated last week and its name is We Are Wizards, which was actually the name of my limited company as a contractor.\nThe website is at https://wearewizards.io (link now dead) and the twitter handle is @WeAreWizardsIO.\nYou can contact us through twitter or send an email to

introduce AngularJS anymore, but here's a (very) small introduction of it to make sure everyone knows the basics.\nAngularJS is a client-side framework, replacing the jquery code usually present on most sites.\nInstead of modifying the DOM on events manually (like displaying a div on a click event), AngularJS takes a declarative approach.\nThe following examples show the difference in paradigm between these two.\n\n\nSome people will not like the fact that you're putting logic in the HTML, I personally much prefer this kind of approach to a\njquery based one, and I find it much easier to organise your code using directives, controllers, services than the usual jquery\nspaghetti.\nFor a real overview, please check the official website.\nStarting a new project\nA problem new developers encounter is how to organise their code.\nFor simple (and I mean -learning how it works- kind of simple only), putting everything in one file is file but obviously does not work once you start working on bigger projects.\nSince I like organising code properly, I looked around to see what was the recommended way for that in AngularJS project.\nng-boilerplate by Josh David Miller\nWhile I didn't find THE answer (there's no imposed structure like in many server-side frameworks so everyone do their own thing, which can be great), I found ng-boilerplate by joshdmiller (link now dead).\nThis boilerplate separates code by feature, containing all the code (including css/html) for that particular feature.\nIt also uses ui-router which is quite awesome.\nIt also comes with a whole lot of grunt tasks to automate dev/test/release cycle: everytime you save a file, it runs the associated task with this type of file and reloads your page.\nI used this boilerplate for a learning project, kCalculator and while it is a very good start, I found it not that practical for my own use (I use Sass, it uses LESS for example) and it had lots of things that I didn't really want.\nMy own ng-boilerplate\nSince I wanted to start a new project (which will be much more complex than kCalculator), I decided that this time I would use something tailored for me.\nRather than forking and changing most of the code of the original, I started from scratch and added feature by feature what I needed.\nResult is ng-boilerplate (yes the name is lazy).\nThe end results differs quite a bit from the original :\n\nno ng-min in the build (since you can do it by hand in your code)\ncoffeescript only\nSass with Foundation\ntemplates and css in their own directory instead of inside their small 'feature app'\nreorganised grunt tasks\nnot concatenating dist libs with app libs (need to implement using CDN for dist libs on release task)\n\nArchitecture example\nHere is the layout of the project I'm working on (this is still very early, probably going to change some things later on) :\n\nAll of the different 'features' are nicely placed under the app folder and each file in it has a unique function.\nThe module.coffee under each looks something like the following:\n\nThis file is the entry point of the feature, injecting all the different modules (list, create, etc) and defining the views (using ui-router).\nAll of the other files are standard AngularJS controllers, services, directives.\nIf I think something can be reused in another feature/project, it goes in the common directory.\nConclusion\nSo far I really like this organisation, and this is working well for now.\nI will update it as the project grows bigger since I will probably find flaws by then.\nHow to learn

common issues working on a web service is where to store your secrets. When just starting, it's likely that\nthey will be directly in the repository itself whether it happens accidentally or not. Having your production secrets\nin the clear in the repository is obviously a bad thing and all those secrets should be rotated.\nThere are multiple ways to store your secrets securely:\n\nstore them in the environment of the servers like Heroku/Aptible do\nstore them as CI/CD variables like in Gitlab and bake them in Docker images\nuse tools like Vault\n\nIf you are on a PaaS with an easy way to set secrets as environment variables, you can stop reading this article and just use that.\nHowever, if you're a small team using a more traditional deployment encrypting secrets in the repository itself is worth\nconsidering. git-crypt can be used for that. To quote the repository:\n\ngit-crypt enables transparent encryption and decryption of files in a git repository. \nFiles which you choose to protect are encrypted when committed, and decrypted when checked out.\n\ngit-crypt is available through many package managers.\nOnce you have git-crypt and are in your repository, run git-crypt init to generate a key. \nThe next step is to create a .gitattributes, a file similar to .gitignore, with the following content:\n\nThis means that everything inside a folder named secrets will be encrypted. It is recommended to use the **/* approach as\nit would be easy to forget to encrypt some files otherwise.\nNow that your .gitattributes file is in place, you can start adding secrets in that folder. Since you have the secrets\nalready unlocked, you will see the file in your git diff or git show.\nYou can check which files are encrypted before pushing by running the git-crypt status -e command:\n\nIf you push it to a remote repository and try to view a file in that directory using the web browser for example, you will notice they are just binary data. \nAnyone getting access to the repository will not be able to see them unless they can unlock git-crypt. That also includes you working from\na different computer or your team members.\nClearly, we need to be able to unlock the secrets in more than one computer. There are two ways to go about it:\n\nGPG\ncreating a symmetric key\n\nYou can read more about the GPG on the git-crypt's README, I will use the symmetric\nkey for this article.\nHere's how you generate a symmetric key:\n\nThis will generate a binary key that, after base64'ing, can be stored in your password manager for example and shared securely\nwith team mates. And that's where the issue with this approach lies: some people might store the key insecurely which would be \nequivalent to storing your secrets in the clear.\nFor a small team that can be trusted however, this is an easy approach that can work for quite some time! \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/storing-secrets-gitcrypt/","title":"Storing secrets in a git repository with git-crypt"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/switching-to-typescript/":{"body":"Until a few weeks ago, I was a convinced user of coffeescript: significant whitespace, no curly braces, list comprehensions, classes, thick arrow, chained comparisons, etc.\nThe list of good things coffeescript brings to the table is quite long, just have a look the coffeescript website.\nThen, Microsoft announed Typescript 1.0 and that made me give a second look to it.\nMy initial reaction the first time I heard about it was something along the line of: eh, they are probably going to stop working on it in a year or so, like lots of their projects.\nTurns out I was wrong !\nI am not going to detail Typescript too much as there is a complete handbook available.\nWhy would I use Typescript ?\nI can see several reasons.\nFirst, it's still mostly javascript, unlike coffeescript which makes it easier to learn (coffeescript is very easy but lots of people will not contribute back if it means having to do it in coffeescript).\nThere is a big thread on Discourse (link now dead) about whether to use Javascript or Coffeescript.\nAfter switching to javascript, more contributions happened so that's definitely something to take into account if you are doing an open source project.\nThe second is obviously types. Having types (in javascript) is awesome.\nAll the typescript type checking only happens for the developer, nothing will be left in the compiled js (which is perfectly readable javascript by the way).\nHaving types also mean that you can have autocompletion available, even for your custom types, which is pretty cool.\nKeep in mind that types are optional, no one forces you to use them if you don't want to.\nIf you decide to use them though, a vital resource for Typescript is DefinitelyTyped which contains definitions for most of the JS libraries.\nThe third would be all the other features that Typescript brings: modules, classes, arrow functions, etc.\nTheir goal is to have an interface similar to what we will have in ES6 but, as ES6 is still changing a lot (for example the module implementation), it can differ quite a bit right now.\nI am confident they will adapt to whatever standard has been adopted, unless they decide to somehow abandon their goal of sticking to ES6.\nHow am I using it\nI finished switching my ng-boilerplate to Typescript and it works pretty well.\nSince I use AngularJS with REST APIs, I can define the types I will receive in the API, methods on controllers/scopes and have some robust code that ensure I didn't call a made-up function or made a typo in an object attribute immediately.\nThe interfaces you define can also serve as a very good documentation and helps if you're dealing with a huge codebase (which is the goal of Typescript).\nI made a simple invoice app (github link) when I was trying it out and it caught many errors before I even opened the page.\nConclusion\nWhile Typescript is not the Holy Grail of Javascript, it makes writing it as nice as coffeescript (coffeescript will be more concise imo though) while having types.\nI can see it working very well once a project gets big but I would use it even for small projects.\nTry it out and see for yourself !\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/switching-to-typescript/","title":"Switching to TypeScript"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/table-of-contents/":{"body":"Heading 1\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

During 2019,\nthe Zola static engine has been keeping up with each Tera release and has therefore been tested quite a bit.\nIf you want to see the TL;DR of all the changes since 0.11.20, you can have a look at the changelog.\nIn most cases, the upgrade to v1 should be painless: unless you are using the error-chain part of Tera errors, it might\neven work without any changes.\nBefore going further, a huge thank you to everyone that contributed.\nLet's look at some of the main changes in a bit more detail now.\nError handling\nError handling is a hot topic in Rust and has been for quite some time. \nAt the time of 0.11, error-chain was the recommended approach but pretty much as\nsoon as I ported all of my code to use it, failure became the go-to crate. Since then,\nsome of failure's features made their way into the standard Error trait including the one I am using: the source method.\nI have pretty much given up on any error handling crate for the time being and just use std::Error for everything, including in this new version of Tera.\nTraits for filter, tests and functions\nPreviously, the type for each was a simple function. It has now been changed to a trait, allowing for each of them to have a context, for example.\nZola, for example, uses structs for some of the functions in order to hold the site data. The trait is automatically implemented for the previous function\ntype so if you had defined your own they should continue to work, as soon as you change their arguments to be borrowed instead of owned.\nWhitespace management\nYou can now use the same whitespace management as Jinja2 in Tera:\n\nwill render hellovincent! if username is vincent. Please see the documentation for more details.\nIncreased rendering performance\nThe whole rendering code has been rewritten to be more performant.\nThe bottleneck is still converting the context to JSON since it needs to clone the data. \nThis is unlikely to change until we move to a borrowed approach but I do not know how to approach that. If\nanyone can figure out a way to solve this issue and still be ergonomic, that would be amazing; please chime in on the related issue.\nHow does it compare with other Rust template engines? There is a benchmark testing just that.\nBefore showing the results, it is important to understand the difference between the compiled templates and interpreted templates:\n\ncompiled template engines: askama, horrorshow and most of the ones\nin that benchmark are generating Rust code through macros. The big upsides of this are performance and being able to typecheck your templates.\nThe big downsides are compilation time and not being able to handle dynamic templates: you cannot render an arbitrary template file.\ninterpreted template engines: Liquid, Handlebars and Tera are in this category.\nThey are not going to be as fast or type-safe as compiled one but can run any templates you throw at them.\n\nFor example, a static site engine could not work using a compiled template engine as users define their own templates, add arbitrary data and extend other random existing templates.\nI've grouped the table output of the templates benchmark (done with criterion.rs) depending on the template engine type.\nThe benchmarks have been ran on a 2018 Macbook Pro.\nBig table benchmark\nThis is running a for loop with a context being an array of length 100 with each element being another array of length 100.\n\nAs you can see, this is a bad case for interpreted template engine. Tera is the fastest among them but is still up to 10x slower than some compiled engines.\nThe result from Handlebars are particularly odd: I do not see why it would be 23x slower than Tera.\nConsidering those results, you should probably use a compiled template engine if you are trying to render some context\nrequiring a lot of allocations like in that benchmark.\nTeams benchmark\nThis is rendering a template with a small array of structs as context, a more realistic average workload.\n\nTera is again the fastest interpreted template engine, but the numbers are small enough that any engine will do the job.\nGlob patterns now supported\nYou can now pass patterns to Tera::new like templates/**/*{html,xml} to load exactly the type of files you want.\nA builtins feature\nThe number of dependencies started to grow quite a bit as filters and functions were being added. \nFrom 1.0.0, a new active-by-default feature named builtins has been introduced. If you disable it, Tera will only\ndepend on the crates needed for parsing and rendering and all the filters and functions that were depending on those\ndependencies will not be present anymore.\nKnown issue\nDue to a bug in pest, the parser generator used by Tera, some template parsing might timeout. There \nare more details in the issue but since the pest contributors are working on v3, \nit doesn't seem worth it to hold on releasing Tera 1.0 for an unknown amount of time until its release.\nThis issue was found while fuzzing but I've been running into https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/66140 when trying\nto run the fuzzer again on OSX.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/tera-v1-is-here/","title":"Tera v1 is here!"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/testing-a-different-spa-routing-update/":{"body":"I've recently wrote an article about a\nframework agnostic routing approach for SPA and promised to post an update once it is a bit more tested.\nI have since moved Proppy from react-router v2 to\nthe structure described in my article and the result is pretty great!\nI did change a few things from it though.\nFirst, the onClick of the Link component was incorrect and has been changed to:\n\nThe store also changed in order to only display an animation after a certain amount of time, avoiding blinking effects:\n\nAny component can now observe showLoadingScreen and render a loading effect very easily. 500 milliseconds is probably\ntoo high but I was on a slow connection several thousands of kilometers away from our servers when I tried it.\nThe only issue we encountered was that some users were faced with a blank page.

There is no need for something specific to React, Angular or anything else.\nI recently started experimenting with it and I think I found a nice setup.\nI haven't tried it for a complex app yet though so it is probably lacking in some ways.\nI will write another article on how it works in a real app when I have the time to try it in Proppy.\nThe solution\nThis example will use React, MobX and router5.\nrouter5 is a nice router library that treats routing state like any application state.\nCombined with MobX, you can have a store that will contain the routing state trivially without any framework.\nI couldn't find an up to date TypeScript definition for router5 so I made one.\nI'm not entirely sure whether this is the correct way to write a definition file though so I will wait a bit before making a PR to DefinitelyTyped.\nRouting setup\nLet's take a very simple routing scheme:\n\nAs you can see, nothing magical going on: routes is simply an array of routes, which are plain JavaScript objects themselves.\nThe Routes type has to be manually updated to match the routes but allows compile-time checking of the routes: a worthy trade-off in my eyes.\nThe canActivate key corresponds to a lifecycle function of router5.\nrouter5 will call this function before transitioning to the new state, preventing the transition if necessary.\nIn that case it is simply the following:\n\nonActivate will be explained in a bit.\nBefore looking at the router setup, let's have a quick look at the MobX router store:\n\nIf you haven't used MobX before, I heavily recommend it and wrote an introduction to it before. In a nutshell,\nthink of the code above as a simple class that has 2 observable values: current and asyncInProgress.\nOk we got our routes and store, we now need to create a router:\n\nThis does a few things. First we create a router using the routes we defined above. We then add 2 plugins:\n\nbrowser: a built-in plugin that will update the browser URL and state on route change using the HTML5 history API\nmobxRouterPlugin: a very simple custom made plugin shown below that will upate the store on transition success and error\n\n\nHow errors are handled is really up to you, I'm focusing on the happy path for that article.\nNext up is the asyncMiddleware that handles any pre-loading we need to do.\nIf a onActivate function on a route is found a route, it assumes it is an async call that returns a promise:\n\nIn practice, the onActivate method of the home route will be called before transitioning and will only be completed if the call succeeded.\nThe store will automatically be notified of the start of an async call and of any successful transition: displaying a loading progress becomes straightforward.\nFinally, we start the router which will automatically use the current URL as the current state as we are using the Browser plugin.\nIntegrating React\nNow that we have the routing is up and running, we need to be able to render components depending on the URL and navigate between pages.\nSince all the routing state is in a MobX store, this is simply a matter of having a component observe it:\n\nThat's it. A simple switch on the name of the current route and we're good to go.\nThere is a small twist for links though: using a basic &lt;a href=\"/forgot-password\"&gt;Forgot?&lt;/a&gt; will trigger a full reload, unless there's an option I missed.\nYou will need to use the router.navigate method to navigate instead.\nIf you are using React you might have a Link component in your project to standardize how links are made and the various styles it can have.\nHere's an example for a basic one:\n\nWhich can be used like so:\n\nThe route name will be checked at compile time as well, no more typos!\nThe end\nWill this work for complex apps?\nI don't know but I will certainly try it and report!\nEdit: It looks like TypeScript 2.4 will support string enums!\nThis means we will be able to not duplicate the Routes content and use an enum instead!\nEdit2: This approach is now in production!

Things like call to a 3rd party service that can take time and require an internet connection.\nYou do not want to mock your own services though unless you have proper integration tests somewhere.\nIn the following example, I will mock a method from the Stripe API to prevent it from actually calling Stripe.\n\nMocking 2 things here :\n\na class method (stripe.Customer.retrieve)\na method (update_subscription of stripe.Customer)\n\nTo accomplish that, you just need to add the right decorators (look into the doc for more info), add the mocks in the test parameters (order matters of course)\nand then define a return_value to these mocks.\nAt the end of the tests I'm just making sure both methods were called and that's it.\nConclusion\nThat's it for how I test django apps, if you want more details or have better ideas, feel free to ask/share !\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/testing-django-projects/","title":"Testing Django projects"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/trying-out-rust/":{"body":"Rust is an in-progress systems programming language (official website).\nI'll start this post by saying I'm a python/js/go developer and never really done C or C++ (my first programming languages were PHP/C# actually since I started with a degree in biology).\nRust is mainly targeting those C/C++ developers that need speed (without a GC) and safety.\nAs a guy who does only web stuff, the absence/presence of a GC is not important since you can use slow languages like python or ruby and be completely fine with it for 99% of the sites so a GC pause probably won't even be noticed unlike in video games for example.\nWhy bother learning low level languages then?\n\nIt's fun\nIt's fast\nIt has types (I love types)\n\nThis is just my feelings after playing with it a few hours, it may contain mistakes and some stuff will probably be outdated pretty soon anyway.\nLike every article I've read, I'll be comparing some of the features with Go but do note that I like them both.\nWhat's Rust?\nAs mentioned above, Rust is a language developed by Mozilla in the open: all the code is on github, decisions are taken by committee.\nA stable release is expected around Q4 of 2014.\nYou can follow or even submit/comment on RFCs on the language: RFCs repo, decisions on these RFCs being taken in meetings for which you can find the transcripts on github as well.\nThe language itself is also in github in case you didn't guess: rust repo.\nMore discussions also happen on reddit (/r/rust) and on the discourse forum.\nI talked quite a bit about the community because I find looking at the evolution quite fascinating, let's talk a bit about the language itself now.\nLet's use bullet points and then go through those individually\n\nStatically and strongly typed with generics (yay!)\nMemory safety\nEasy concurrency with no data race\nFunctional stuff\n\nType system\nIt is pretty cool.\nVariables are immutable by default and the compiler will complain if you are using a variable before initalizing it (not very idiomatic in Rust to initialize a variable after declaring it apparently anyway) or if it's unused (you can make that fail compilation if you want).\nIt has generics which allows some cool stuff without passing interface{} if you wanted to do something similar in Go (let's say an ORM).\nIt uses traits rather than the classic interfaces OOP languages, if you've used Scala it will be familiar.\nMemory safety\nPart of that section could go in the type system section but since this is the complex part of rust for newcomer like me I feel it deserves its own section.\nThere are 3 types of pointers in Rust:\n\nowned pointers: the classic ones, compiler takes care of them automatically\nborrowed pointers: as the name implies, you can use them when you want to access data, but without taking ownership of it\n\nOwnership (and mainly the lifetimes that go with it) is a major point of Rust and documentation will do a better job than me at explaining them: The Rust References and Lifetimes Guide.\nEasy concurrency with no data race\nConcurrency in Rust is as easy as in Go, here's a very basic example:\n\nIt is very easy to read and I actually find it easier to have the named channels like this than reading from the channel.\nThe \"no data race\" part comes from the fact that you cannot access mutable data inside a task (It won't even let you reuse the tx variable here in another as you can see in that playpen.\nTrying to modify a mutable structure for example would result in a compiler error: playpen.\nAn in-depth explanation is also present in the docs: The Rust Tasks and Communication Guide.\nFunctional stuff\nI'm usually a bit wary of functional elements as it can sometimes be very hard to read and understand at a glance what a functional programmer did when he was being 'neat'.\nNevertheless, functional programming also brings very very cool stuff:\nOptions\nAn idiomatic Go function will usually return 2 elements: a value and an error. You will have to check whether the error is nil or not and handle both cases\n\nI don't mind explicit error handling but it's easy to forget it somewhere and end up with a null pointer exception.\nOptions are basically nullable types that forces you to handle them, enforced by the compiler.\nIt is typically handled using pattern matching.\nPattern matching\nThose are amazing, like a switch but way more powerful.\nTo handle something that could fail like the Go example above, it would look like this.\n\nA playpen is available here, modify the paraneters to divide and the pattern matching to see how it works.\nYou could match on types, on values, this makes the code really neat imo and is awesome.\n\nGeneral 'functional' functions\nI did the first Euler problems in Rust to get the hang of it and everytime I started with the naive approach of looping.\nAfter reading a bit of code from experience devs, I realised you could do some nice stuff like defining a Fibonacci iterator and making a simple one liner after that to solve problem 2:\n\nWhat do I think of it?\nAs you saw from the previous part, I'm quite enthusiastic about it.\nIt's still too much in flux to be used seriously but I think that it could become a pretty big thing.\nAgain, talking from the point of view of websites/services, it could become a nice alternative to Go (as more and more companies start using it for services).\nThe fact that they're also building a package manager (Cargo) along the language is a very nice thing, solving the whole dependencies issues in Go, I need to find out whether they plan to include vendoring or not.\nI think Go is easier to pick up (language has less features, some people will consider that a minus, other a plus), has the community behind it and tools like gofmt (one is in the works for Rust).\nAnother issue Rust currently has is that it is changing very fast, most of the threads/posts talking about it will not work in the current version and that is confusing.\nUp to date resources includes:\n\nhttp://rustbyexample.com/\nhttp://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html (very helpful since there's no autocompletion yet, there's racer but it doesn't seem finished)\n\nOverall, I'll keep an eye on it and try to do a small project on it as soon as I have some free time.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/trying-out-rust/","title":"Trying out Rust"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/trying-rust-for-web-services/":{"body":"Developing web apps in dynamic languages is a breeze when using frameworks like Django for Python.\nThe downsides are that software written in dynamic languages is harder, at least in my opinion, to maintain, to refactor and you also need to write tests to cover potential errors that would simply not be possible with a compiler.\nWhile I would use Flask or Django for a small project, I would definitely prefer having help from a compiler for a long-lived product. The fact that compiled languages are generally faster than dynamic ones is a nice bonus too.\nThe two choices in my mind right now for a compiled language are Go and Rust. Some (ie Tom) would say Haskell, others would say Scala but in the end it's down to preferences.\nI previously used Go for a few projects and I quite liked it despite some annoying quirks such as package management (might be solved by gb now) and seeing interface {} in some libraries to get around the weak type system. On the other hand, I have been following Rust development for quite a while but didn't play with it more than a couple of toy programs. I was keen to see if it could work as the backend for a web app, which in short means a HTTP server receiving and sending JSON while talking to a Postgres database. There are obviously an awful lot of other things but let's keep it simple for now.\nThe demo\nYou can see the project at https://github.com/Keats/webrust.\nThis is a simple webapp with one endpoint that responds to either a GET or a POST. The GET handler will return all the passwords in the table and the POST will insert a record into the table and return a 201 status code.\nFor the HTTP framework, I have used Iron which was simple to use, granted I only created 2 routes and had no middlewares but there are other alternative such as rustful and nickle.rs.\nFor the postgres side, there is a crate (the term for a package in Rust) called postgres. I'm also using a pool manager called r2d2 because I didn't know about Arc and couldn't pass the connection itself as it wasn't thread safe.\nThe Makefile for Postgres was taken from another Iron + Postgres project I have found on Github: rustwebapp (link now dead).\nKeep in mind I'm a newbie in Rust so there are probably lots of things I'm doing wrong in there, feel free to point them out!\n\nNote: the server is currently quite slow, only handling around 6.5k req/s for the GET handler, removing the database part makes it shoot up to 70k req/s so something must be going wrong somewhere around postgres\n\nWhat I liked\nCargo, Rust package manager, works pretty damn well and its configuration file Cargo.toml is easy to write and understand. It is also used to build and run your package.\nThe language itself is very nice and easy to get started, granted this demo is very simple and doesn't have a single lifetime. Every single time the compiler didn't complain, whatever I wanted to do was working and whenever it complained, the message was clear enough for me to realize what was happening.\nThis is not going to be exhaustive by any means but here are the things I liked and disliked the most.\nResult and Option types\nEvery Go developers has been caught forgetting the if err != nil when calling a function, every Python developers has seen exceptions that they didn't realise could happen. Rust (and some functional languages it's borrowing the concept from) bake those in the language, using the Result type.\nIn practice, this means that by returning this type, the caller has to handle the possible errors. It wouldn't even compile if you didn't as we will see later, unless you use .unwrap() which is a way to get panics if there is an error.\nThe Option types is the same as the Maybe in FP, it represents the possibility of a value which Javascript would benefit greatly from for example (undefined is not a function anyone?).\nPattern matching\nThe easiest way to handle the above types is called pattern matching and is awesome in Rust.\nAs an example from the demo, here's how to handle the Result from list_passwords that fetches all the passwords from the table in our handler:\n\n\nNote: Rust automatically returns the last value, in that case the Ok() ones. Iron handler return type is a Result so I should probably return an Err but it currently works well enough™\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Rust forces us to handle the result properly: removing the Err branch errors with the following message error: non-exhaustive patterns: Err(_) not covered [E0004].\nPattern matching is obviously not limited to Result and Option and can be used anywhere you would want a if/else or a switch.\nMacros\nMacros are a way to abstract some code but, instead of a function call, the macro is expanded where it's called at compilation time. In practice it means you can simplify code without the overhead of calling a function. The most used macro is probably try! which returns the error if there is one or gives the result value otherwise. Here's an example from the demo: while trying things out I ended up with the following two lines in each http handler to get a connection to postgres.\n\nAs you can see, I use unwrap which means it can panic in case of errors. I wrote the following macro to clean it up:\n\nThe last line in the snippet will get a connection or will return a 500 if anything fails in the middle.\nYou can even have macros checking SQL syntax or HTML one at compile time! Neat!\nWhat I didn't like\nI think it can be summed up in one word: documentation.\nMost of the crates I have looked at (except the postgres one) have next to no real documentation, only a maze of links to click in the generated rustdoc that pulls the in-code documentation into a nice looking website. This is useful if I want to know more details about a type or a trait but doesn't help me understanding how am I supposed to use it. Having to go through the tests or the code directly to see what I am supposed to do for every crate instead of having a \"How to use\" documentation is annoying.\nThe provided documentation can also be outdated as it is currently not integrated with Cargo. There is an open issue for that though.\nRust for a backend yet?\nI don't think I would use Rust if I had to choose a backend language right now. The toy project was intentionally small but there are lots of other things needed for a backend not shown here:\n\nsending emails: I found rust-smtp but haven't tried it\ntemplates: needed for example for emails, there is handlebars and if I have time I would like to port a subset of Jinja2. There is also some compile-time HTML templating using macros such as maud\nserialization e.g. between services : there is rust-protobuf\ndatabase migrations: we could probably use Alembic, a python library\nlogging\nerror reporting\nand probably a bunch of other things that I can't think of right now\n\nThere are also a few open questions where I haven't spent the time to look for the answer:\n\ntesting: are there hooks available somewhere to truncate the database between tests?\nmocking: often you want to mock things in test, how would that work in Rust?\n\nI think that, with a bit more time, the ecosystem will be good enough to make Rust a good first choice but it is not there right now. If I had to start a project now, I would lean towards Go but who knows for the one after!\nAs mentioned before, I'm a Rust beginner so do not hesitate to correct me and I would definitely appreciate PRs on the demo to see how it could improve.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/trying-rust-for-web-services/","title":"Trying Rust for web services"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/trying-to-replace-json-with-protobuf/":{"body":"Protocol buffers or other binary serialization formats like Thrift are widely used to communicate between services.\nWhat is Protobuf\nProtobuf is a binary serialization format from Google meant to serialize structured data.

The data is generated randomly on startup of the flask app.\nThe repo is in our github if you want to try it yourself.\nAs mentioned in the README, the Python library for Protobuf does not support Python 3 (yet) so you will have to make a Python 2 virtualenv if you decide to install the server.\nThe server will deliver the content in JSON or Protobuf based on the Accept header.\nServer-side\nFirst we need to define our Protobuf schema, which is done in the addressbook.proto file. Here is one of the model as example:\n\nIn this model, first_name and last_name are required (controversial, I'll come back to that later), the address model is optional and we can have 0, 1 or n phone_numbers.\nNow, Python doesn't know about .proto files so we need to use the Python library to generate code that we can use. This is the addressbook_pb2.py file. You can then import that in your Python code and access the models defined in your .proto file.\nHave a look at the data.py file to see an example. You can use those models as you would with a class and using kwargs for every attributes.\nYou also need to serialize them before sending, using the SerializeToString() method in our app.\nClient-side\nThe client is written in Angular purely as an example and because ng-repeat was exactly what I wanted here. The code is a quick prototype so don't expect it to be idiomatic.\nIt uses ProtoBuf.js as a Protobuf library.\nThe first thing we do is a basic GET to get all our contacts which is trivial since you can just dump the response data into our scope variable. On the other hand, we need to handle Protobuf deserialization since looking at our network tab we receive binary data looking like:\n\n(Note that I had to replace some of the characters so the RSS could be generated).\nBy default, this is more compact than JSON by quite a bit but once I turned on GZIP, the difference became much smaller: 851B for ProtoBuf and 942B for JSON.\nIn the example I copied the .proto file into the static directory and created our models following the ProtoBuf.js tutorial.\nNow the only two things left to do for our GET is to add a responseType: 'arraybuffer' in our HTTP requests (which would be done in the config for a proper angular app) and decode the data we receive using MyModel.decode(data).\nCreating an instance looks like a class in JavaScript as well:\n\nNote that supplying an incorrect parameter such as an unknown field will result in a runtime error.\nPOSTing is a bit more complex as Angular tries to be too clever and forces us to do some changes in the HTTP request:\n\nConclusion\nWhile I see the need for Protobuf and Thrift for services communication, I don't really see the point of using it instead of JSON for the frontend.\nFirst, the network tab becomes pretty much unusable and I use it very often.\nSince Protobuf doesn't use setters, you can use wrong types in your object and it will only throw an error much later, but earlier than with vanilla JavaScript. Using Typescript or Flow with good definitions would solve many issues at compile time.\nAnother point I raised earlier is that Google recommends to mark every field as optional in Protobuf, which is better in terms of compatibility but means you can send incomplete data.\nHas any of you used a binary serialization for that successfully?

kitchen table was half eaten.\nThe bite was seriously huge, think a good 100g of bread + meat.\nA previous accident, garbage bag being torn, suggested we might have a rodent issue in the house (or anything else really).\nBeing curious about who (could be a sleepeating housemate!)/what the hell ate my lunch, we decided to investigate with my flatmates.\nNo droppings and the quantity of food eaten rule out mice — or at least we think so, unless we're up against a colony of ninja mice — leaving us with rats, squirrels or stray cats: a small window was open in the kitchen, big enough for a small animal to enter.\nThe best way to find out what it is being actually seeing it, we decided to put some bait out and film the kitchen at night.\nWe don't have a camera but we have webcams on our laptop.\nHow hard could it be to create a script to take pictures with it at a set interval ?\nI ended up creating Rodent to solve that issue.\nOne of my flatmates is a designer (Barbara Marcantonio, you can look at her website) and made a logo for it for fun.\n\nBelow is an explanation of how it works, this is pretty basic but that was new to me !\nInstallation\nThe installation is a bit tricky as it uses OpenCV and needs a few dependencies for video/images (you will need the libjpg one for the pictures at least).\nThe setup for Ubuntu is described in the README, I haven't tried to install it on any other OS so I cannot comment on it.\nHere's a photo of actualy physical installation:\n\n\n\n\nWe were not sure of what we are trying to catch so the bait is pretty much a bit of everything: nutella, bread, tuna, cheese etc\nAPI\nRodent exposes 4 methods:\n\ncapture: takes a picture from the webcam at a given interval forever or until the time specified in the folder given\nmake_video: takes all the pictures in the folder and makes a video out of it, better than watching pictures!\nautomate: does both capture and make_video, I use it for example to record until 15 minutes before I wake up and the video will be ready by the time I get to the kitchen\nmotion: takes a picture only if it detects a movement (the sexy part)\n\nLet's get down to business\nThe first part I did was to take pictures at a set interval.\nOpenCV exposes the webcam very simply:\n\nSo this gives us an image, we now need to save it, once again OpenCV makes this very easy:\n\nThis works, but the main issue is that an image saved that way is around 64kB, which can be a lot if you take a picture every seconds for a whole day.\nMy first try was to open the image in PIL and save it right away while lowering the quality a bit:\n\nI realised while writing that part that I could also specify the compression directly in OpenCV and skipping PIL entirely!\n\nThis gives an image of about 21kB, 3x times lower than the original one.\nA pretty big save when multiplied by several thousands.\nPutting it together with an interval, the code is:\n\nA simple basic infinite loop that breaks on CTRL+C or if the time is over, nothing fancy.\nI'll make a video out of you\nOnce again, OpenCV provides pretty much everything needed to make a video out of the box.\n\nThe only tricky part is to take an image to get the size of the video and the fourcc parameter which is the 4-character code for the codec, which I pretty much tried randomly until I got one that works.\nRight now the fps is determined completely arbitrarily depending on the number of pictures so it's highly probable that it will be too slow or too fast, simply change the value of the 3rd parameter to VideoWriter.\nThe only issue is that it seems that OpenCV doesn't write the last few images somehow.\nThe motion detection\nLet's get to the interesting part, the motion detection.\nThe need for that arose after the first night of the home-made CCTV: watching minutes of footage of a still background is not very interesting.\nRather than taking a pic every second, how about only taking a pic only if movement is detected, that would reduce the number of pictures significantly and make looking at it less boring.\nSince we only care about movements, all the pictures for that part are converted to grayscale:\n\nAlgorithms\nThe first obvious thing I tried was taking 2 pictures and doing a diff of them (again, OpenCV provides it through the absdiff method).\nThis worked okay-ish, the main issue being having ghosts in the motion.\nEnter another algorithm, which I absolutely can't remember where I read about it unfortunately so I don't even know its name, which makes you compare 3 pictures instead of 2 and do a bitwise and between the 2 results.\nThis is what I currently use but a text explanation would be boring for a computer vision program so let's walk through the code along with pictures.\nHow it works\nWe have 3 pictures: previous, current and the loop one.\nWe want to get the difference from the one in the loop compared to the previous and the current one.\n\nIn practice the difference looks like the following:\n\n\nYou can see my outline, with a pretty cool effect imo, as I was moving in front of the camera.\nNext we want to know the if something changed in both differences, done with the OpenCV bitwise_and method.\n\nThis gives a result similar to the above, but usually more faint.\nI personally love this kind of picture, it gives a watercolour like effect.\nHere you can see my arm while I was standing up, a bit on profile:\n\n\nTo make it clearer and know what you're looking at, I tried to highlight the outline of my body:\n\n\nWe then want to apply a binary threshold to only get clear motions:\n\nThis means that for every pixel in the result, turn those with a value above 40 (arbitrary value, seems to give good results but open to changing it!) to 255 (white).\nThis is the picture above after the thresholding:\n\n\nA picture after threshold with no motion would be completely black.\nWe now have an image with the areas where a motion occured in white and we only need to check if we have some pixels with a value of 255 in the image to know if there was a motion.\nSince we know that, we might as well highlight the area where a movement occured: Rodent does that by putting a purple rectangle around the area.\nThe code is not that interesting and lives in utils.py/find_motion_boundaries if you want to check it out.\nIt simply finds the lowest/highest point (X, Y) in the image with 255, becoming the coordinates for the rectangle and None if there was no motion.\nAdding a rectangle to an image is trivial as well:\n\nNote that the rectangle method does the transformation in-place, it doesn't return the new image.\nHere's what a motion made into a video looks like:\n\n\nResults\nWe still haven't caught the culprit but Rodent has been quite fun so far !\nThis is the first time I'm using OpenCV and it is very powerful, the API is not very pythonic but works very well.\nAlso, don't forget to delete the camera object because it happened to me that the webcam refused to turn on until I rebooted after a several CTRL+C, it is now handled properly by catching KeyboardInterrupt.\nThe space below is reserved for a picture of the culprit once we catch him.\n[Insert screenshot of culprit once caught]\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/turning-a-laptop-into-cctv/","title":"Turning a laptop into a

my workflow.\nHere's what's different from that time (spoiler: mostly the build system).\nStructure\nThe structure is very similar to what I had before:\n\nIf you compare with the previous version, you can notice it changed a bit.\nThe templates, tests and styles are placed in their own directory (with tests being separated by unit and integration) since I personally find it cleaner that way.\nI've seen quite a few people mentionning they were putting all of this in the feature directory but to me it makes it hard to find stuff (I use the same templates and tests directory in my django projects as well so it may be an habit).\nIn the style directory, you might have noticed the snowflake thing.\nThis is my base SCSS (you can see the repo on github: https://github.com/Keats/snowflake) which is Bourbon (for the mixins you would usually use compasss), Neat (for the grid system) and Bitters (for the typography for now).\nBuild and features\nThe previous build system was using Grunt but I switched to Gulp as the config file made much more sense to me (and way simpler to understand and faster).\nThe build does the same thing the Grunt was doing and a few additional things:\n\nwatch over .coffee file and compile them\nwatch over .sass file and compile them\nwatch over .html file and minify them (wasn't there before)\nwatch over the images in the assets directory and copy them when added/modified\nreload the page when any of this is happening\n\nAnother thing I added is Protractor (end to end testing using webdrivers) support.\nBy default, it does not run on the watch task as it can take some time but a CI task that run both unit and integration tests is available (and runs on travis with the .travis.yml file provided).\nIf you have an opensource project on github, Travis CI works out of the box.\nWhat's next\nI'm pretty happy with the current setup, the only thing I'm thinking of is to use coffeescript classes a bit more instead of functions for controllers and services but I haven't explored that too much yet.\nAnother thing I do on my own project but didn't do in that boilerplate is checking in the node_modules and libs directory. I do that in order to not have failures on CI or on deploy due to internet or npm issues but I prefer giving people the choice and keeping the repo small so it's still gitignored for now.\nAny

article.\nPresentation of CBV\nFirst thing, a quick introduction of CBV.\nThe 'old' way of doings views in django is something like the following:\n\nAn identical version using CBV would be:\n\nThe main advantage of using CBV lies in being able to inherit from mixins and making the code much more compact and readable (\nthis is obviously from my point of view, some people won't like the fact that they don't see exactly what's happening).\nFor example, let's say you want to process a form (very basic one, on GET returns the form, on POST check for errors and show them if\nnecessary or do something and redirect to another URL in case of success).\nIn a FBV, processing such a form looks like that:\n\nAnd in a CBV\n\nThis is so much neater imo.\nGo CBV !\nThere are generic classes for every CRUD action and it's easy to create your own mixins on top of it.\nThe most common would be a LoginRequired one, working like the login_required decorator.\nA JsonResponse one is also a good example of a useful CBV mixin (for more, look at django-braces).\nOne pattern that we use all the time in Hizard (and most web app need the same kind of features) is checking that the user is allowed to see/do certains actions.\nIn this case, we have mixins like RestrictedDetailView, RestrictedListView, etc that does the check automatically for us, the only thing we have to do is inheriting from them.\nHow cool is that ?\nInstead of having huge FBV unorganized (I've seen in the hundreds of line unfortunately), you can divide everything into methods neatly and have much cleaner and easier to read code.\nFBV is not dead !\nFBV is the traditional way to represent requests handling in lots of frameworks/languages, making it much easier for a new django dev to understand what's going on.\nOn some cases, it even makes more sense to use them rather than FBV (I'm thinking about views with several forms for example).\nYou also need to take into account that most current codebase use FBV and lots of developers don't know how/don't want to use CBV.\nConclusion\nSeeing the number of people not liking CBV, I assume I'm in the minority of people that thinks they are a fantastic tool to make your code cleaner, reusable and easier to maintain (you want to add another check on your LoginRequired ? much more annoying to do with decorators and FBV).\nEven if you're not using generic CBV, just using a CBV inheriting from View will cleanly separate GET and POST.\nThe main problem with CBV is the documentation I think but once you get the hang of it, it's awesome.\nIn the end it's a matter of preference and what the team decides : I use CBV on my own projects and FBV at work.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/using-class-based-views/","title":"Class-based views VS function-based

It contains a single distribution nearly as it would be installed according to PEP 376 with a particular installation scheme. Although a specialized installer is recommended, a wheel file may be installed by simply unpacking into site-packages with the standard 'unzip' tool while preserving enough information to spread its contents out onto their final paths at any later time.\n\nTo put it simply, wheels are a way to have your own local instant pypi.\nWhy should I care\nI actually read a few articles on it some time ago but didn't see the usecase before actually using it myself.\nHere are a few concrete examples on how you could possibly use them:\n\ninstant installation on localhost: having a global wheel directory where you can pull your libs from without going to pypi and doing so almost instantly, even for libs requiring compilation (lxml, pyscopg2, pillow, etc)\ndeploying without needing pypi: obviously the compiled libs won't work if you are using different systems for developing and in production but the rest will work\nWAY faster installation of requirements: it takes only a few seconds to install, compared to a possibly long time depending on what you are using. Think of the time your builds on CI are taking just to install the requirements.\nmaybe deploy your project as a wheel? I haven't thought about it too much but that should be possible and you could change version using pip, the downside being that your project would be in the site-packages directory so it would be a bit annoying for management commands for django fo example\n\nI don't mind waiting a bit for my pip install but the deploy without pypi and the faster builds are killer features in my eyes.\nHow to use them\nLet's imagine you have a project you want to convert to using wheels.\nYou would have your dependencies in a requirements.txt (or several requirements file for different environments).\nThe first thing you need to do is installing wheel.\n\nAt this point you remember that not even 10 lines above, I said we didn't use to use pypi to deploy.\nWheels are zip archives that python can execute so that means we can actually use the wheel of wheel to install wheel (yo dawg, I heard you liked wheels).\nYou could download the wheel manually and installing using whatever deployment system you are using but let's install from pip locally.\nNow that you got pip and your requirements file ready, time to reinvent the wheels (haha...).\nFor example, this is the result of running it in my Django REST Framework template\n\nA ls in wheelhouse gives me the following:\n\nThis shows pretty well the format of wheel filenames:\n\n{distribution}-{version}(-{build tag})?-{python tag}-{abi tag}-{platform tag}.whl\n\nThe platform tag part is important, as a wheel compiled on mac will not work on an Ubuntu machine for example.\nTo install my requirements from my wheels, I simply need to tell pip where to look for:\n\nThe no-index part flag ensures that pip won't try to look it up in others sources than the directory we specify in find-links.\nDelete your virtualenv and see how fast it is to install now (apparently wheel ignores URLs though, you could install the wheel file manually as explained above).\nThis is roughly the workflow with using wheels for your project.\nWheels definitely look like a win for every environment:\n\ndev: instant installation of most of your pip packages across your projects if you are using a shared wheel directory\nci: faster build and not reliant on pypi\nprod: not reliant on pypi to deploy\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/using-python-wheel/","title":"Python wheels"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/using-sass-modules-typescript/":{"body":"A few months ago, I mentioned in my articles about setting up Webpack with TypeScript (part 1 and \npart 2) that CSS modules would be a nice addition to it. Here we go!\nWhat are CSS modules?\nOne common issue for anyone writing CSS is specificity. As a site grows, the number of CSS rules and classes grow. \nThis makes it easy to accidentally re-use an existing class name by inadvertence and wonder why your text is now red. \nCSS modules are pretty simple. Let's start by writing CSS/Sass/Less as you would normally do:\n\nYou can then import the file in your .js/.ts variable (like import styles from \"_style.scss\";) and access the class names from it: styles.title.\nNot very impressive but if you look at the source of your HTML page you will notice the class is some random combination of letters and numbers.\nThis is the powerful part of CSS modules: each class gets its own unique name which means that there cannot be specificity issues anymore.\nThere are a few other ways to solve the specificity issues:\n\nuse something like BEM, which requires discipline\nuse a CSS-in-JS library like emotion, which is more complex and has lower performance than alternatives\nhope for the best\n\nAdding CSS module to the Webpack boilerplate\nTurns out enabling them is really easy! The only tricky part is, as some might have guessed from the example above, ensuring\nTypeScript does not error when loading the Sass file.

We served more than half a billion polls in the past eight months and had 1.1 million active voters in September. To everyone that made this possible, our heartfelt thanks.\nIf you voted on a Polar poll, downloaded our app, our embedded us in your site, we learned from you. Personally, I learned more than I could imagine from the Polar team, our partners, and investors. I can’t imagine a better gift than knowledge, so I’m grateful to all of you.\nSharing What We Learned\nIn an effort to return the favor, we took some time to package up the articles I wrote over the past two years about Polar’s mobile and multi-device designs. We’re making this compilation freely available in:\nFree Mobile &amp; Multi-Device Design Book by Luke Wroblewski\nEach version is filled with nuanced user interface design details and big-picture thinking on mobile and multi-device design for PCs, tablets, TVs, and beyond. It’s our hope that some of our experiences, insights, and missteps, will ultimately help you with the product journey you’re on now or will be in the future.\nIf you used Polar, we’ve made it super-easy for you to download an archive of the polls and data you created –they’re yours after all. We’ll also be keeping the site running for a while to help with this transition.\nBig bear hugs &amp; thanks,\nLuke Wroblewski &amp; Team Polar\nGithub billing\nWe are having a problem billing the pica8 organization.

Rackham的英文版本。\n我能从哪里获取？\n如今互联网提供各种各样版本的Lorem Ipsum段落，但是大多数都多多少少出于刻意幽默或者其他随机插入的荒谬单词而被篡改过了。如果你想取用一段Lorem Ipsum，请确保段落中不含有令人尴尬的不恰当内容。所有网上的Lorem Ipsum生成器都倾向于在必要时重复预先准备的部分，然而这个生成器则是互联网上首个确切的生成器。它使用由超过200个拉丁单词所构造的词典，结合了几个模范句子结构，来生成看起来恰当的Lorem Ipsum。因此，生成出的结果无一例外免于重复，刻意的幽默，以及非典型的词汇等等。\n\njiffy\ntime(7): jiffy并不是固定的时间，和内核版本、硬件都有关。\nMonorepo\nPros:\n\nCons:\n\ngit-interpret-trailers - Add or parse structured information in commit messages\n\nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/git-interpret-trailers\n\nConventional commits\n一種用於增加提交說明之人機可讀性意義的規範\n\nhttps://www.conventionalcommits.org/\n\nGenerate changelog from commit messages\n\nhttps://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog\n\nSummary\nThe Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages.\nIt provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history;\nwhich makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.\nThis convention dovetails with SemVer,\nby describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.\nThe commit message should be structured as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThe commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the\nconsumers of your library:\n\nfix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).\nfeat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).\nBREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning).\nA BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.\ntypes other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:,\nci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.\nfooters other than BREAKING CHANGE: &lt;description&gt; may be provided and follow a convention similar to\ngit trailer format.\n\nAdditional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE).\n\nA scope may be provided to a commit's type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/wil/","title":"2022 11 WIL"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/working-on-gulp-sass/":{"body":"gulp-sass v2 was released today!\nIn itself, this is not a big change as this is simply a wrapper for node-sass which uses libsass so, while this version is a complete rewrite this is not the important news. The important news is that it ships with node-sass v3 which is using libsass 3.2.2.\nWe will see in a short moment why it is exciting but first a small explanation on what is sass and libsass.\nTL;DR:\n\nSass\nNowadays, most front-end developers and designers use CSS preprocessors to immensely simplify their work.\nA CSS preprocessor brings variables, nesting, mixins, functions and other things to CSS.  Let's see a short example of why we would use one, in this case using variables for colours:\n\nAnd in Sass:\n\n\nThe above ignores best practices about naming/nesting/specificity of selectors for the sake of example.\n\nWhile the Sass version is longer, it makes your CSS more readable, easy to organise and consistent. This is only a tiny part of what CSS preprocessors but it hopefully gives you an idea on why they are extremely useful.\nSass is one of them. There is also less, stylus and a few others but I personally use Sass so I will be talking about that.\nSass is written in Ruby, which means that Ruby is now needed to build your frontend. Ruby is also not the fastest programming language around and the compilation was taking more than 10 seconds for some large projects, which is not really sustainable when working.\nHere comes a new challenger\nAaron Leung started porting the Sass compiler to C/C++.\nLots of people (including me) started playing with it and were impressed by the compilation time an order of magnitude faster than sass but quickly realized that lots of features were not implemented yet, for example this article. While it was usable for some projects, it could not be a drop-in replacement for most people as you would have to use workarounds for some features and not use some others at all or were using frameworks like Bourbon or earlier versions of Foundation.\nHugo Giraudel started a website called Sass Compatibility to keep track of those incompatibilities.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, gulp-sass is now using libsass 3.2.2 while it was using 2.0 before and the results of that website look pretty damn good !\nMost features are supported except for selector manipulation and string functions, both of which I didn't even know existed in the first place.\ngulp-sass\nAs mentioned in the introduction, gulp-sass has been rewritten and it means that your existing tasks won't work.\nHere's how to update your gulpfile (from the README):\n\nAny options passed to gulp-sass will be passed down to node-sass, there is no gulp-sass specific options.\nAs a general advice, I would recommend using gulp-autoprefixer along as it simplifies your Sass even more since you don't have to worry about browsers prefixes and flexbox syntaxes.\nThere are already issues open on gulp-sass but if you encounter problems (except installations errors, those are most likely node-sass), please open an issue on https://github.com/dlmanning/gulp-sass/issues so we can have a look !\nThere was over 45k downloads of gulp-sass on npm last week so spread the word about that new version and it might be a good time to try replacing your Ruby Sass!\nAs an aside, if you are writing Sass I heavily recommend reading those guidelines as they are really good and well detailed.\nThe only thing missing for me now in the Sass ecosystem is a Ruby-free linter (sounds like a fun Rust learning project).\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/working-on-gulp-sass/","title":"Release of gulp-sass v2"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/working-on-rust-projects-in-april-2017/":{"body":"I have just released v2 of jsonwebtoken and\nthought a blog post would be a good way to talk about the progress of jsonwebtoken, Tera and Gutenberg this month.\njsonwebtoken\nVersion 2 is almost a full rewrite, but trying to keep the UX as good as possible.\nThe following improvements have been made:\n\nuse serde instead of rustc_serialize: no brainer as serde is now usable on stable and reached 1.0.0\nRSA signing and verification\nValidation\n\nValidation is the main thing that was missing from version 1 and brings jsonwebtoken to almost parity with libraries\nin other languages.

So here it is, my first crate (the name for packages in Rust): jsonwebtoken (code on github).\nWhat are JWTs\nFirst of all a very quick introduction on JSON Web Token (JWT). If you already know about them you can skip this.\nJWTs are a way to transmit data using JSON — hence the name — and are mostly used for APIs and token based authentication. You can read the standard there.\nRather than having a session in a database, you would store some non-sensitive data in your token that allow you to identify the user.\nHere's what a JWT looks like (with the fields shortened for example's sake):\n\nFrom the code above, you can see that a JWT has 3 parts, separated by a ..\nAll of those parts are base64 encoded, which means it is trivial to decode (remember the non-sensitive data point above?).\nThe first is the header, that typically contains the following:\n\nThe second is the claims object, which contains an arbitrary JSON object. There are\nsome reserved claim name such as exp for an expiration timestamp but none of them are\nmandatory. Typically in an app, you would store the user id along as some token metadata such as exp mentioned above for example.\nThe last part is the signature which is obtained the following way in pseudo-code:\n\nAs you can see it's quite a convenient way to transfer some data and the signature ensures that the payload was not tampered with (there are some issues though, such as this vulnerability).\nEnter jsonwebtoken\nI was implementing JWT in a Go project using the jwt-go library when I realised a JWT library was something simple enough that I could try in Rust.\nWe can see there are already crates for that available but one only allows string types and the other put too much important on the registered claims to my liking.\nI didn't implement the standard to the letter as I wanted to keep it simple for now and not support some part of it (having none a valid value for the alg header makes no sense to me therefore is not supported).\nCompared to the Go library (which is quite good!), using Rust allows leveraging generics to have type-safe claims.\nFor example, the claims in jwt-go are stored in a map[string]interface{} which is the only way to do so and therefore need type assertion when decoding claims to access its true type. The next version (v3 at the time of writing) seem to allow passing a struct though.\nHere's how jsonwebtoken is used in practice, taken from the example in the crate:\n\nOn the other hand, decoding the token gives you an instance of the Claims struct declared in the function and thanks to the Result type, we are certain that if we are in the Ok() branch, the variable contains valid data.\nHow cool is that? And we can use any struct we want as long as the struct we use satisfy the Part trait, which is done automatically by deriving RustcEncodable and RustcDecodable.\nI'm guessing other languages with generics implement similar things for their JWT libraries but it feels cleaner to me compared to the current version of the Go one.\nThoughts\nHere are some thoughts on the process of creating that crate.\nCargo\nCargo is really cool. It probably is the smoothest package manager of all the programming languages that I've tried.\nFrom installing crates to publishing the package on crates.io, everything works.\nI think the main thing missing for me is built-in vendoring, to not be dependent on a third party (crates.io).\nError handling\nOne of the most annoying thing for me in Go is all those if err != nil. After trying Rust, I wish there was an equivalent of the try! macro so I could get rid of all that code cluttering my functions.\nThe Result type makes error checking mandatory to handle them, like in the example above. Pattern matching also has to be exhaustive, meaning that every possible value of the type I am matching has to be handled, from numbers to enum members and errors.\nTesting and benchmark support\nHaving tests built-in the language and the package manager is very nice, ensuring there is no barrier to tests.\nIt is missing an easy setup and teardown method though but I think I have seen macros for that and, hopefully, someone will make a tool similar to the amazing goconvey.\n.to_owned()\nIf you look at that the code, it is littered with to_owned() calls which converts a string literal (&amp;str) into a String.\nI wish there was a quickway to create a String (maybe there is but I haven't found it yet other than writing a macro) such as typing a string into backtick for example:\n\nProbably a silly idea but it would make things like tests less noisy.\nCommunity\nThe IRC channels (#rust and #rust-beginners on irc.mozilla.org) and the rust subreddit were very helpful.\nConclusion\nThat was quite a pleasant experience!\nWhile I'm still very much a complete newbie in Rust, I'm looking forward to making another library in Rust.\nIt will probably some kind of port of migrate, ie a tool to handle SQL migrations.\nIf you have any comments or find a bug, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request to the repo.\nLastly, thanks to the pyjwt library for the API inspiration!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/writing-my-first-crate/","title":"Writing my first Rust crate:
