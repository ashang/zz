It works with all devices that support Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), and some older devices. WPA2/WPA3 Transitional is a mixed mode that uses WPA3 Personal with devices that support that protocol, while allowing older devices to use WPA2 Personal (AES) instead. WPA2 Personal (AES) is appropriate when you can't use one of the more secure modes. In that case, also choose AES as the encryption or cipher type, if available. Weak security settings to avoid on your router Don't create or join networks that use older, deprecated security protocols. These are no longer secure, they reduce network reliability and performance, and they cause your device to show a security warning: <p>WPA/WPA2 mixed modes WPA Personal WEP, including WEP Open, WEP Shared, WEP Transitional Security Network, or Dynamic WEP (WEP with 802.1X) TKIP, including any security setting with TKIP in the name Settings that turn off security, such as None, Open, or Unsecured, are also strongly discouraged. Turning off security disables authentication and encryption and allows anyone to join your network, access its shared resources (including printers, computers, and smart devices), use your internet connection, and monitor the websites you visit and other data transmitted over your network or internet connection. This is a risk even if security is turned off temporarily or for a guest network.</p> <p>Network name (SSID) Set to a single, unique name (case-sensitive) for all bands</p> <p>The Wi-Fi network name, or SSID (service set identifier), is the name that your network uses to advertise its presence to other devices. It's also the name that nearby users see on their device's list of available networks.</p> <p>Make sure that all routers on your network use the same name for every band they support. If you give your 2.4GHz, 5GHz, or 6GHz bands different names, devices might not connect reliably to your network, to all routers on your network, or to all available bands of your routers. If your router is providing a Wi-Fi 6E network that isn't using the same name for all bands, Apple devices that support Wi-Fi 6E will identify the network as having limited compatibility. Use a name that's unique to your network. Don't use common names or default names such as linksys, netgear, dlink, wireless, or 2wire. Otherwise, devices that join your network are more likely to encounter other networks that have the same name, and then automatically try to connect to them.</p> <p>Hidden network Set to Disabled</p> <pre style=background:#0f1419;color:#bfbab0><code><span>A router can be configured to hide its network name (SSID). Your router might incorrectly use “closed” to mean hidden, and “broadcast” to mean not hidden.
</span><span>
</span><span>Hiding the network name doesn't conceal the network from detection or secure it against unauthorized access. And because of the way that devices search for and connect to Wi-Fi networks, using a hidden network might expose information that can be used to identify you and the hidden networks you use, such as your home network. When connected to a hidden network, your device might show a privacy warning because of this privacy risk.

</span><span>To secure access to your network, use the appropriate security setting instead.

</span><span>  Set to Disabled
</span><span>
</span><span>  When this feature is enabled, your router can be set up to allow only devices that have specified MAC (media access control) addresses to join the network. You shouldn't rely on this feature to prevent unauthorized access to your network, for these reasons:
</span><span>
</span><span>  It doesn't prevent network observers from monitoring or intercepting traffic on the network.
</span><span>  MAC addresses can easily be copied, spoofed (impersonated), or changed.
</span><span>  To help protect user privacy, some Apple devices use a different MAC address for each Wi-Fi network.
</span><span>  To secure access to your network, use the appropriate security setting instead.

If the device always uses the same Wi-Fi MAC address across all networks, network operators and other network observers can more easily relate that address to the device's network activity and location over time. This allows a kind of user tracking or profiling, and it applies to all devices on all Wi-Fi networks. <p>Starting with iOS 14, iPadOS 14, and watchOS 7, your device improves privacy by using a different MAC address for each Wi-Fi network. This unique MAC address is your device's private Wi-Fi address, which it uses for that network only.</p> <p>In some cases, your device will change its private Wi-Fi address:</p> <p>If you erase all content and settings or reset network settings on the device, your device uses a different private address the next time it connects to that network.</p> <p>Starting with iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and watchOS 8, if your device hasn’t joined the network in 6 weeks, it uses a different private address the next time it connects to that network. And if you make your device forget the network, it will also forget the private address it used with that network, unless it has been less than 2 weeks since the last time it was made to forget that network.</p> <p>Join Wi-Fi networks with a private Wi-Fi address Connect to Wi-Fi networks like you normally do. A private Wi-Fi address doesn't affect how you join or use most Wi-Fi networks.</p> <p>If a network doesn’t allow your device to join, or doesn’t allow it further network or internet access after joining, you can follow the steps bellow to stop using a private Wi-Fi address with that network.</p>
