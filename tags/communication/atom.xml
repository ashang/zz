day one: How
GitLab thrives
Sid Sijbrandij, cofounder and CEO of
GitLab Inc., on how the organization builds
a cohesive culture and helps its team
members thrive in a fully remote workplace.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitLab’s roughly 2,100 team
members span more than
60 countries—and every single
one of them works remotely. Unlike many
companies that were abruptly forced to
close their offices during the COVID-19
pandemic, GitLab has embraced a remote-
work environment from its inception in 2011.
It is now one of the largest fully remote
organizations in the world.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under cofounder and CEO Sid Sijbrandij,
the company has evolved from an open-
source collaboration tool for programmers
to an end-to-end development, security,
and operations (DevSecOps) platform
with more than 30 million registered users.
Its rapid growth is underpinned by a set
of norms, systems, and processes that
enable its global workforce to collaborate
across time zones and schedules.
We spoke with Sid about how GitLab team
members stay connected, sustain a healthy
culture, and manage their time within a
remote and asynchronous workplace.
One of the things that differentiates
GitLab is that it’s fully remote. How
have you maintained connectivity and
built culture in this environment?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working remotely is easy. The challenge
is working asynchronously. Organizations
must create a system where everyone
can consume information and contribute
regardless of their level, function,
or location. We invest in working
practices that enable asynchronous
communication, and we’ve committed
to educating and supporting other
companies through the global transition
to remote work that started during
COVID-19 and continues today.
Within GitLab, our handbook, which is
more than 2,700 web pages and available
to the public, is a big part of what enables
us to work asynchronously.1 When an
employee has a question, they can almost
always find the answer documented in our
handbook, without having to tap someone
on the shoulder.
The “handbook first” system is
embedded in the way we work. Every
change must first be documented in the
handbook, and all communications about
the change include a link back to the
handbook. We work together to make
sure it is always up to date. For example,
our CMSO [chief marketing and strategy
officer] is responsible for maintaining the
marketing section, though anyone can
propose edits as needed.
Effective internal communication is
crucial in fast-paced organizations
like GitLab. How has that manifested
at GitLab?
We rely on informal communication to
develop closeness and camaraderie. Our
onboarding process2 trains people in
how—and how often—we communicate
with each other: every new hire initiates
five virtual coffee chats so they learn that
it’s normal to schedule meetings with a
colleague just to connect, whether it’s
work related or not.
In-person events are also a fantastic
way to build this culture, but only if you’re
intentional about how you use them. A
lot of companies bring people together,
then lock them in a conference room to
sit through PowerPoint presentations for
a couple of days. That’s a waste of time
and money. They could have watched
those presentations asynchronously.
At GitLab, we spend most of our
in-person time going on excursions,
sharing meals, or holding an
“un-conference,” where small groups
discuss topics one after another. We
use our valuable time together to build
connections through the kind of face-to-
face interactions that can take place only
outside of our screens.
What processes are in place to help
employees manage their time in a
remote and asynchronous working
environment?
We’re very thoughtful about how we
use our time. For example, meetings
shouldn’t just be gatherings of people
for a conversation. Unless it’s a coffee
chat, every meeting must have an
agenda, and people are expected to
read the agenda before the meeting. Our
meetings end at the 25- or 50-minute
mark to give people time to prepare for
their next meeting. We also try to make
it acceptable for people to look away
during meetings—they manage their
own attention and participation—and
to interrupt politely to ask questions or
share context, just like you would during
in-person conversations. We take notes
during every meeting and, when possible,
record them so people who can’t attend
can still hear the conversation, and we
aim to resolve discussion with clear next
steps, owners, and delivery dates.
How does the culture at GitLab
contribute to its success?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important, we maintain a bias
for action. Everyone at GitLab is
empowered to be proactive, creative,
and effective. We all must make
decisions with imperfect information;
this mindset helps us make the small
ones more efficiently. We document
them and maintain the ability to change
them if necessary, but there’s cultural
support for everyone to do what they
feel is best, instead of calling meetings
to debate every choice or action. We
have a higher tolerance for mistakes
and an appreciation for which decisions
need discussion. Overall, this approach
helps us to be more effective.
How do you build and strengthen the
culture over time?
Culture isn’t preserved. It evolves.
You have to measure what you want to
reinforce. At other companies, there
is still a lot of presenteeism out there—
where team members are rewarded for
just showing up, responding quickly, and
looking like they are working day and
night. If that’s what you reward, that’s
what you’re going to get. It’s much better
to reward the results. At GitLab, we
evaluate team members using metrics
that are relevant to their roles. For
example, in R&amp;amp;D, we measure how many
pieces of code land in production. What
matters is not the number of hours you
work—it’s the work that gets done.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Culture isn’t preserved. It evolves. You have to
measure what you want to reinforce.’&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
